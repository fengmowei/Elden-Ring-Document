（呼救）
Oi! You there!
Could you help us out, cully?
You, yeah, you there! Stop pretending you can't see me!
Why won't anyone look me in the eye?
I-I'm not that ugly, am I?</text>

<text>
（初见、自我介绍）
Ow! What'd you go and do that for!
Hm? Oh, yes, I remember.
Some clod turned me into a tree.
You were just breaking the spell, weren't you.
Thank you.
The name's Boc.
I was pushed out of the cave.
Told not to come back, not ever.
Then I ended up as a tree.
Lucky you came along, really.</text>

（第二次对话）
Oh, what a shame.
When they threw me out of the cave, 
they took everything I owned,
and so this is all I have to express my thanks.
I hope you can forgive me.
Or, if you can afford to wait for a while, 
I could sneak back into the cave, 
and bring back something of actual value.
Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon.</text>

（第三次对话）
Right, but I'll need a moment.
I-I'm frightened of them...
So I have to gather myself.
My knees start knockin'...
just thinking about that god-awful 
cave on the shore...

（被攻击）
Why'd you go and do that? 
It's because I'm ugly, isn't it? 
Now, you too, is it? 
The story of my rotten life...
I never wanted this...
Mum... Mum... I've... I've let you down...</text>
