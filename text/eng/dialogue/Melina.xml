（初见、自我介绍）
Greetings.
Traveller from beyond the Fog.
I am Melina.
I offer you an accord.
Have you heard of the finger maidens?
They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, 
and aid, to the Tarnished.
But you, I am afraid, are maidenless.
I can play the role of maiden.
Turning rune fragments into strength.
To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring.
You need only take me with you.
To the foot of the Erdtree.</text>

<text>
（同意合作）
Then its settled.
Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength.
Ahh, another matter.
I bequeath to you this ring.
Use it to traverse great distances.
It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent.
Torrent has chosen you.
Treat him with respect.

（拒绝合作）
I understand.
I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger.
Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.
Summon me by grace if you should reconsider.</text>

（关于赐福）
This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree.
This light once shone in the 
eyes of your Tarnished brethren.
But now it is all that guides you.
Or so I hear.
You can see them, can't you? 
The rays of grace, 
that guide you through your burden.</text>

<text>
（关于梅琳娜）
Me, I'm searching.
For my purpose,given to me by
my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the
reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless.
There is something for which I must apologize.
I've acted the finger maiden yet
I can offer no guidance, I am no maiden.
My purpose was long ago lost.</text>

（升级）
Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
Share them with me,
your thoughts, your ambitions,
the principles you would follow.
（暂缺“……这样就结束了”）

（再次同意、升级）
Have you reconsidered my offer?
Shall I turn your runes to strength?
Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
Share them with me.
Your thoughts, your ambitions,
the principles you would follow.
It is done.</text>
