<text> The Tarnished will soon return. </text>
<text> Guided by Grace once lost. </text>
<text> The Golden Order is broken to its core. </text>
<text> They will fight. And they will die. In an unending curse. </text>
<text> For how else is a champion, or a lord, to be born? </text>
<text> Brandish the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> ...for all of us. </text>
<text> The fallen leaves have spoken. </text>
<text> Of the return of the Tarnished. To the Lands Between. </text>
<text> Elden Ring, O, Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Shaper of life, arbiter of fate. </text>
<text> Lord of the very stars above. </text>
<text> Tarnished warrior, spurned by the grace of gold. </text>
<text> Seek that which hath been lost to thee. </text>
<text> Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between. </text>
<text> Seek the Elden Ring! </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished. Mighty warriors, who fought at my side. </text>
<text> Await the summons. It will call to thee one day. </text>
<text> Heed the fading grace. Listen to the Fingers. </text>
<text> Gold commandeth the very stars, </text>
<text> giving life its fullest brilliance. </text>
<text> Elden Ring, O, Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Be ready, once it is shattered. </text>
<text> Seek the Elden Ring, O Tarnished. </text>
<text> Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between. </text>
<text> Become Lord. Enact thy will! </text>
<text> Seek the Elden Ring! </text>
<text> Long ago, ye Tarnished lost something most dear. </text>
<text> The Elden Ring. O Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Its gold commanded the very stars, </text>
<text> giving life its fullest brilliance. </text>
<text> Though shattered, it yet guides thy kin. </text>
<text> Though fractured, it yet guides thy kin. </text>
<text> Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between. </text>
<text> Hoarah Roux, the Gold Mask. </text>
<text> Lady Yuliya, the Deathbed Companion. </text>
<text> The hideous Dung Eater. </text>
<text> And Sir Gideon Orphnier, the All-knowing. </text>
<text> Each coveteth the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> But their ambitions are yet unmet. </text>
<text> Surely thou hast thine own design? </text>
<text> Then implore the Two Fingers, for guidance. </text>
<text> Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between. </text>
<text> To face the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> To stand before the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Face the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> And reclaim what was thine. </text>
<text> Elden Ring, O Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Its gold commanded the very stars, </text>
<text> giving life its fullest brilliance. </text>
<text> Shattered, by someone, or something. </text>
<text> Fractured, by someone, or something. </text>
<text> Godrick, the feeble. </text>
<text> Malenia, decayed from birth. </text>
<text> General Radahn, slayer of giants. </text>
<text> Rykard, the tyrannical serpent. </text>
<text> And Morgott, Prince of the Omen. </text>
<text> Each, inheriting their own shard, played a part in the Shattering, </text>
<text> a war with no end, and no victor. </text>
<text> And so the Two Fingers call upon ye, the Tarnished. </text>
<text> To cross the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between. </text>
<text> To seek the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Seek the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> The fallen leaves tell a story. </text>
<text> The great Elden Ring was shattered. </text>
<text> In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between. </text>
<text> Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found, </text>
<text> and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was first to perish. </text>
<text> Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering. </text>
<text> A war from which no lord arose. </text>
<text> A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will. </text>
<text> Arise now, ye Tarnished. </text>
<text> Ye dead, who yet live. </text>
<text> The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all. </text>
<text> Hoarah Loux, chieftain of the badlands. </text>
<text> The ever-brilliant Goldmask. </text>
<text> Fia, the Deathbed Companion. </text>
<text> The loathsome Dung Eater. </text>
<text> And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing. </text>
<text> It happened an age ago. </text>
<text> But when I recall, I see it true. </text>
<text> On a night of wint'ry fog. </text>
<text> The Rune of Death was stolen, </text>
<text> And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden. </text>
<text> Queen Marika was driven to the brink. </text>
<text> The Elden Ring was broken, </text>
<text> triggering the Shattering, an internecine war between demigods. </text>
<text> The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn. </text>
<text> And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed. </text>
<text> These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat. </text>
<text> But there would be no victor. </text>
<text> And so, we inhabit a fractured world. </text>
<text> Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown? </text>
<text> It happened an age ago. </text>
<text> But when I recall, I see it true. </text>
<text> On a night of wint'ry fog. </text>
<text> Bearers of Black Knives stole into the dark. </text>
<text> And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden. </text>
<text> Queen Marika was driven to the brink. </text>
<text> The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness. </text>
<text> The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why? </text>
<text> What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring? </text>
<text> The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn. </text>
<text> And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed. </text>
<text> These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat. </text>
<text> But why was there no victor? </text>
<text> And so, we inhabit a fractured world. </text>

<text> You think this is the one, Torrent? </text>
<text> Is that him, Torrent? </text>
<text> Is that her, Torrent? </text>
<text> Don't worry, it's not too late. </text>
<text> He is sure to seek the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> She is sure to seek the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> ...For that is their curse. </text>

<text> But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. </text>
<text> I can play the role of maiden. </text>
<text> Turning runes into strength. </text>
<text> To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> You need only take me with you. </text>

<text> Then it's settled. </text>
<text> Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. </text>
<text> Ahh, another matter. </text>
<text> I bequeath to you this ring. </text>
<text> Use it to traverse great distances. </text>
<text> It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. </text>
<text> Torrent has chosen you. </text>
<text> Treat him with respect. </text>
<text> I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger. </text>
<text> Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding. </text>
<text> Summon me by grace if you should reconsider. </text>
<text> Have you reconsidered my offer? </text>
<text> Shall I turn your runes to strength? </text>
<text> Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. </text>
<text> Phew. It is done. </text>
<text> This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren. </text>
<text> But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. </text>
<text> You can see them, can't you? </text>
<text> The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden. </text>
<text> Me? </text>
<text> I'm searching. </text>
<text> For my purpose, given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree, long ago. </text>
<text> For the reason that I yet live, burned and bodiless. </text>
<text> There is something for which I must apologise. </text>
<text> I've acted the Finger Maiden, yet can offer no guidance. </text>
<text> I am no maiden. My purpose…was long ago lost. </text>
<text> Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer. </text>
<text> A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring. </text>
<text> If the rays of grace signal the castle, </text>
<text> then the Elden Ring beckons you. </text>
<text> As an ally by pact, </text>
<text> ...I pray that you are fit... </text>
<text> To face the challenge presented by the Ring. </text>
<text> Spoken echoes linger here. </text>
<text> Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago. </text>
<text> If you wish, I will share them with you. </text>
<text> Very well. In Marika's own words. </text>
<text> My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace. </text>
<text> With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. </text>
<text> Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die. </text>
<text> Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance. </text>
<text> Of course. Perhaps there is no need. </text>
<text> Tell me if you should change your mind. </text>
<text> Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well. </text>
<text> Shall I share them with you? </text>
<text> In Marika's own words. </text>
<text> Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed. </text>
<text> Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey. </text>
<text> In Marika's own words. </text>
<text> The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine. </text>
<text> Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it. </text>
<text> To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart. </text>
<text> In Marika's own words. </text>
<text> Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved. </text>
<text> Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God. </text>
<text> But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken. </text>
<text> Amounting only to sacrifices... </text>
<text> In Marika's own words. </text>
<text> O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. </text>
<text> Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self. </text>
<text> In Marika's own words. </text>
<text> I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased. </text>
<text> Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. </text>
<text> My comrades; why must ye falter? </text>
<text> In Marika's own words. </text>
<text> Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. </text>
<text> Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand. </text>
<text> Put the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount. </text>
<text> Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life. </text>
<text> Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree! </text>
<text> Forgive me. I've been...testing you. </text>
<text> To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. </text>
<text> And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. </text>
<text> It seems my worries were unfounded. </text>
<text> Torrent had your measure from the very start. </text>
<text> Whereas I merely pretended. </text>
<text> There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance. </text>
<text> I can take you to the Roundtable Hold... </text>
<text> Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace... </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. </text>
<text> Forgive me. I've been...testing you. </text>
<text> To determine if the Elden Ring would truly have you. </text>
<text> If you had the mettle to endure this long and arduous path. </text>
<text> It seems my worries were unfounded. </text>
<text> Torrent had your measure from the very start. </text>
<text> Whereas I merely pretended. </text>
<text> There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance. </text>
<text> I can take you to the Roundtable Hold... </text>
<text> Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace... </text>
<text> Your seamster, Boc... </text>
<text> He is always eager to see your return. </text>
<text> Please, will you talk to him, when you can? </text>
<text> I'm sure he would be much contented. </text>
<text> Your seamster, Boc... </text>
<text> I see him crying, from time to time. </text>
<text> I think he misses his mother. </text>
<text> He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful. </text>
<text> Does being born of a mother... </text>
<text> Mean one behaves in such a manner? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Is there...another person inside of you? </text>
<text> Did you...want that to happen? </text>
<text> I sense no malice. Do as you think best. </text>
<text> Hello, other you. </text>
<text> I am Melina, and I have an accord with this person. </text>
<text> We might be together for some time. </text>
<text> Pleased to meet you. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Is there...another person inside of you? </text>
<text> Did you...want that to happen? </text>
<text> I sense no malice. Do as you think best. </text>
<text> Hello, other you. </text>
<text> I am Melina, and I am travelling with this person. </text>
<text> We might be together for some time. </text>
<text> Pleased to meet you. </text>
<text> The Erdtree...is close. </text>
<text> Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled. </text>
<text> It takes me back. </text>
<text> I was born at the foot of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Where mother gave me my purpose. </text>
<text> Though now, everything is lost to me. </text>
<text> I...have to ascertain for myself. </text>
<text> The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless. </text>
<text> My utmost thanks. </text>
<text> For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Here, I can govern my own movement. </text>
<text> And thus, the accord is fulfilled. </text>
<text> I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given. </text>
<text> Farewell. </text>
<text> I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you. </text>
<text> I wish you luck, in realising your ambition. </text>
<text> You have fought long and hard. </text>
<text> I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne. </text>
<text> Hello again, old friend. </text>
<text> It's me, Melina. Your travelling companion. </text>
<text> Allow me a moment to converse with you. </text>
<text> You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no? </text>
<text> Prevented by the mantle of barbs. </text>
<text> The thorns are impenetrable. </text>
<text> A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without. </text>
<text> The only way to stand before the Elden Ring... </text>
<text> and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns. </text>
<text> My purpose serves to aid in that very act. </text>
<text> So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me. </text>
<text> To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants. </text>
<text> Then I can set the Erdtree aflame. </text>
<text> And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. </text>
<text> I wish to journey with you once more. </text>
<text> To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants. </text>
<text> Then I can set the Erdtree aflame. </text>
<text> And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Think not, of the kindling. </text>
<text> I shall see to that. </text>
<text> All I ask of you is to make the journey. </text>
<text> To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds. </text>
<text> I know... </text>
<text> I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin. </text>
<text> But it must be done to reach the path beyond. </text>
<text> And that is the path I wish to travel. </text>
<text> What is your mind? </text>
<text> There is something I'd like to say. </text>
<text> My purpose was given to me by my mother. </text>
<text> But now, I act of my own volition. </text>
<text> I have set my heart upon the world that I would have. </text>
<text> Regardless of my mother's designs. </text>
<text> I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that. </text>
<text> Not even you. </text>
<text> We're almost there. </text>
<text> The flame of ruin lies just ahead. </text>
<text> I'm glad it was you I travelled with. </text>
<text> I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. </text>
<text> Thank you, Torrent. </text>
<text> Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end. </text>
<text> I have long observed the Lands Between. </text>
<text> This world is in dire need of repair... </text>
<text> and Death...indiscriminate... </text>
<text> Are you prepared... </text>
<text> To commit a cardinal sin? </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Tell me, when you are fully prepared. </text>
<text> Are you ready to commit a cardinal sin? </text>
<text> If you intend to claim the frenzied flame, </text>
<text> I ask that you cease. </text>
<text> It is not to be meddled with. </text>
<text> It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. </text>
<text> However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair... </text>
<text> Life endures. Births continue. </text>
<text> There is beauty in that, is there not? </text>
<text> If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion. </text>
<text> Please, leave the frenzied flame alone. </text>
<text> I shall see to the kindling. </text>
<text> It is a purpose which I choose to fulfil. </text>
<text> So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone. </text>
<text> The frenzied flame is not to be meddled with. </text>
<text> It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. </text>
<text> So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone. </text>
<text> I ask you, one more time. </text>
<text> Please, seek not the frenzied flame. </text>
<text> As one who strives to become a Lord, </text>
<text> deny not the lives, the new births of this world. </text>
<text> Those who would are not fit to be called Lord. </text>
<text> When the land they preside over is lifeless. </text>
<text> Please, put a stop to this madness. </text>
<text> The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all. </text>
<text> When the land they preside over is lifeless. </text>
<text> You...have inherited the frenzied flame. </text>
<text> A pity. You are no longer fit. </text>
<text> Our accord ends here. </text>
<text> But remember... </text>
<text> Should you rise, as the Lord of Chaos, </text>
<text> I will kill you, as sure as night follows day. </text>
<text> Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes. </text>
<text> Goodbye, my companion. </text>
<text> Goodbye, Torrent... </text>
<text> You...have inherited the frenzied flame. </text>
<text> A pity. You are no longer fit. </text>
<text> Our journey together ends here. </text>
<text> And remember... </text>
<text> Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos, </text>
<text> I will kill you, as sure as night follows day. </text>
<text> Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes. </text>
<text> Goodbye, my companion. </text>
<text> Goodbye, Torrent... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> You, please, I can read them. </text>
<text> Your fingers, please, your fingers... </text>
<text> Oh, bless you. </text>
<text> Oh..ohh! </text>
<text> Within the fog, a gaping hole. Beyond the fog, one cursed by blood. </text>
<text> Below the surface, traces of those who lurk in the shadows. </text>
<text> In the east, the east. Should you desire… </text>
<text> Oh, bless you. </text>
<text> Oh..ohh! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Heavens, how can this be! </text>
<text> A dreadful sign! Truly dreadful! </text>
<text> You will face wrath, then madness, and finally, chaos. </text>
<text> Turn back. </text>
<text> This is a path you must forsake. </text>
<text> Dread awaits you in the south. Blackest dread! </text>
<text> Dragon slayer... </text>
<text> Ohhh, dragon slayer... </text>
<text> You unfeeling barbarian. </text>
<text> Planning to feast? On dragon? </text>
<text> At an abandoned church on that wee isle. </text>
<text> You would devour the heart of an ancient? </text>
<text> You wretched, undeserving brute! </text>
<text> Oh, bless you. </text>
<text> Oh..ohh! </text>
<text> Head to the foundation of gold, Tarnished... </text>
<text> Traverse Raya Lucaria; "Glintstone Eventide"… </text>
<text> …and reunite the half crescents, at the Grand Lift. </text>
<text> Oh, but the bridge is collapsed, and cannot be crossed. </text>
<text> Only, why should that matter! </text>
<text> Stormveil Castle still stands tall! </text>
<text> Oh, bless you. </text>
<text> Oh..ohh! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Miquella's favour can be yours… </text>
<text> Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter... The all-hearing slaughtered, but alas, it was for naught. </text>
<text> But all you need do, is snatch it from the big pot. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Pity the poor, poor fool! </text>
<text> Oh, bless you. </text>
<text> Oh..ohh! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> …Are you one for festivals? Or flowers? </text>
<text> To the South, a grand festival to make the stars turn. </text>
<text> To the East, the hardened bud of a flower to be. </text>
<text> But dare you enter? </text>
<text> Into the heart of the scarlet rot? </text>
<text> Ah...ahhh... </text>
<text> What a pity it is, to be without the right. </text>
<text> All you can do is stand, at a loss. </text>
<text> Without even the half crescents that wish to be whole. </text>
<text> Before the unmoving, unfeeling Grand Lift ahead. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Or, are you planning to throw yourself to the waters? </text>
<text> To find the coward's passage, through the dim cavern? </text>
<text> What a pity it is, to be without the right. </text>
<text> Oh, bless you... </text>
<text> Bless you... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> You. The one who holds both half crescents. </text>
<text> Take the path to the Grand Lift ahead. </text>
<text> For you...are the one who will be Lord. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Bear witness, one and all! The Lord is returned! </text>
<text> The Elden Lord is come again! </text>
<text> Oh, bless you... </text>
<text> Oh..ohh! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> To the east...ruins of gold. To the west...the serpent's sacrilege. </text>
<text> Wherever the path leads, so shall you follow. </text>
<text> Wherever the path leads, only more sorrow. </text>
<text> Tis a curse! A curse! The curse of Queen Marika! </text>
<text> Ah...ahh... Ha...ha... </text>
<text> The Fingers I served once prophesied... </text>
<text> A Tarnished would one day become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Surely you see it, too? </text>
<text> The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light. </text>
<text> O Tarnished, hasten to the foot of the tree. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> And whatever you might face... </text>
<text> The Fingers will surely guide you... </text>
<text> Turn back. </text>
<text> Ahead lies the Land of the Giants' Flame. </text>
<text> And the way forth is forbidden. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Hear me. The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. </text>
<text> Doing so will unbind Destined Death, and slay the world itself. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Who would dare put you up to such a task? </text>
<text> Most certainly not the Fingers! </text>
<text> Ohh... </text>
<text> Oh, Lord Godwyn... </text>
<text> Such cruelty, such humiliation... </text>
<text> My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death. </text>
<text> As the first of the demigods to die. </text>
<text> As a martyr to Destined Death. </text>
<text> But why must it yet bring such disgrace? </text>
<text> A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death... </text>
<text> How could such a thing come to be... </text>
<text> &lt;sobbing&gt; </text>
<text> Ohh... </text>
<text> Oh, Lord Godwyn... </text>
<text> My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death. </text>
<text> A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death... </text>
<text> How could such a thing come to be... </text>
<text> &lt;sobbing&gt; </text>
<text> Ha, ha, ha! </text>
<text> A curse! A curse upon you! </text>
<text> Your path leads only to death! </text>
<text> You godless brute. </text>
<text> You'll soil your hands soon enough. </text>
<text> With mortal sin! </text>
<text> Are you that new Tarnished? </text>
<text> You've done well. I am Enia, the Finger Reader. </text>
<text> I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will. </text>
<text> Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer. </text>
<text> Let their wisdom wash over you. </text>
<text> Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> Anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all joy. </text>
<text> Until it was shattered. </text>
<text> The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll. </text>
<text> Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces. </text>
<text> Foul curses and misery spread, unabating. </text>
<text> But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it. </text>
<text> So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act. </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome shard of the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Seek another of its kind. </text>
<text> To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order. </text>
<text> Let the words of the Fingers guide you. </text>
<text> Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods; </text>
<text> the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished. </text>
<text> Listen, the Fingers speak. </text>
<text> The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods. </text>
<text> Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left. </text>
<text> The Fingers have willed it so. </text>
<text> ...Indeed. But remember one thing. </text>
<text> The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. </text>
<text> Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... </text>
<text> The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted. </text>
<text> Well, well… I see… </text>
<text> A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession. </text>
<text> Demigods, and even the greater of the champions, </text>
<text> are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances. </text>
<text> They are…valuable indeed. </text>
<text> These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters. </text>
<text> And should you wish to wield that same power, well… </text>
<text> I will lend you the strength of the Fingers. </text>
<text> Heh… Do not recoil from my offer. </text>
<text> The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not? </text>
<text> Ah. You have returned. What is it? </text>
<text> Now, go forth. </text>
<text> Let the words of the Fingers guide you. </text>
<text> I had my doubts, but...my, look at you. </text>
<text> Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together. </text>
<text> Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance. </text>
<text> Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased. </text>
<text> You have earned the right to become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Now, seek the Erdtree, and an audience with Queen Marika. </text>
<text> To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order. </text>
<text> The Fingers expect... </text>
<text> As much from you as they do young Gideon. </text>
<text> Take this. A token of farewell. </text>
<text> Now, go forth. </text>
<text> Become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision. </text>
<text> A god, in truth. </text>
<text> But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree. </text>
<text> A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood. </text>
<text> The Fingers speak... </text>
<text> Marika's trespass demanded a heavy sentence. </text>
<text> But even in shackles, she remains a god, and the vision's vessel. </text>
<text> Confer Great Runes to become Elden Lord, and join Queen Marika as her consort. </text>
<text> The Fingers have willed it so. </text>
<text> Now, you may go. </text>
<text> Well, you managed to return. </text>
<text> You know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you. </text>
<text> The Fingers remain still. </text>
<text> Shaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will. </text>
<text> When they are finished, the Fingers will again offer their guidance. </text>
<text> But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass. </text>
<text> No matter for me. But you? How will you ever manage the wait... </text>
<text> My, oh, my... </text>
<text> It may be thousands upon thousands of moons before the fingers again offer their guidance. </text>
<text> My, oh, my. Whatever will you do… </text>
<text> Heavens forbid... </text>
<text> That is not the domain of mere men. </text>
<text> The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. And you say you seek the power of the Rune of Death, too? </text>
<text> The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death. </text>
<text> The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation… </text>
<text> Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable... </text>
<text> The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> But here we are... </text>
<text> The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will. </text>
<text> The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers. </text>
<text> Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever? </text>
<text> Go on. Finish the job. </text>
<text> Take the course you deem most worthy. </text>
<text> You must find kindling. </text>
<text> Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants, on the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree. </text>
<text> But special kindling is required to reignite the flame. </text>
<text> For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame. </text>
<text> And can lead you to the Rune of Death. </text>
<text> You've done it, I see. </text>
<text> What use do you have for me, now? </text>
<text> I am a Finger Reader. I will remain here, until their dialogue ends, and the Fingers speak again. </text>
<text> Do as you please. Take whatever course seems most worthy to you. </text>
<text> Now, you may go. </text>
<text> Heh, heh, heh. </text>
<text> You'd force this tired old crone to work, even now? </text>
<text> A harder taskmaster have I never met. </text>
<text> Don't worry, my dear. </text>
<text> I'll see it to the end with you, if it please. </text>
<text> Now, go forth. </text>
<text> Do what you believe is right. </text>
<text> Oh, such a fine gift, I will gladly accept. </text>
<text> But don't raise your hopes; </text>
<text> I have no secrets for you to plunder. </text>
<text> I lost my appetite for them a lifetime ago, or more. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished. </text>
<text> I am the witch Renna. </text>
<text> I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed. </text>
<text> And upon looking into the matter, </text>
<text> the talk, I surmise, is of thee. </text>
<text> Thou'rt possessed of the power, no? </text>
<text> To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent. </text>
<text> Ah. As I had hoped. </text>
<text> I was entrusted this, for thee. </text>
<text> By Torrent's former master. </text>
<text> Tis a bell for calling forth spirits. </text>
<text> Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree. </text>
<text> The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past. </text>
<text> Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest. </text>
<text> Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished. </text>
<text> I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between. </text>
<text> How long will it be, I wonder... </text>
<text> Before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> This way, Tarnished. </text>
<text> May I have a word? </text>
<text> Trifle not with me, Tarnished. </text>
<text> Or didst thou merely forget? </text>
<text> The name of the spectral steed thou callest? </text>
<text> I will ask thee again. </text>
<text> Thou'rt possessed of the power, no? </text>
<text> To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent. </text>
<text> Quite the stubborn one, aren't we? </text>
<text> Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty. </text>
<text> Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit. </text>
<text> I shall leave this for thee, at the behest of Torrent's former master. </text>
<text> Take it, shouldst thou overcome thy suspicion. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> What hopest thou to profit? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> No sense in arguing, I see. </text>
<text> Thou'rt a wild one, indeed. </text>
<text> Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Let us speak of the past, a while. </text>
<text> I was once an Empyrean. </text>
<text> Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title. </text>
<text> Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. </text>
<text> But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers. </text>
<text> I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away. </text>
<text> I would not be controlled by that thing. </text>
<text> The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since... </text>
<text> And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins. </text>
<text> Oh, again we cross paths. </text>
<text> I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met. </text>
<text> It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty... </text>
<text> But Tarnished, what business hast thou here? </text>
<text> I have no memory of inking thee an invitation. </text>
<text> Mm? a Tarnished, here? </text>
<text> Thou must have some business in mind, to come all this way. </text>
<text> Though I have no memory of inking thee an invitation. </text>
<text> I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we. </text>
<text> Indeed, I am the witch Ranni. </text>
<text> I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite. </text>
<text> I did it all. </text>
<text> But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here. </text>
<text> I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away. </text>
<text> And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved. </text>
<text> Hah! </text>
<text> And why should I reveal that to thee? </text>
<text> I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed, </text>
<text> but all the same, thy begging compels me not a jot. </text>
<text> The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say. </text>
<text> Now, begone. </text>
<text> The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say. </text>
<text> Now, begone. </text>
<text> Oh, is that so? </text>
<text> Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal? </text>
<text> Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Very well... </text>
<text> There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme. </text>
<text> What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee, </text>
<text> I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends... </text>
<text> I'll allow it. Enter my service. </text>
<text> And good hunting to thee. </text>
<text> Hah! </text>
<text> No reason in particular, thou claimest? </text>
<text> Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion. </text>
<text> Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this encounter. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Wilt thou enter into my service? </text>
<text> I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path. </text>
<text> That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before. </text>
<text> Well? Has that roused thy interest? </text>
<text> I see. A choice well made. </text>
<text> Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer. </text>
<text> But I require as much of those under my command. </text>
<text> I anticipate good work from thee. </text>
<text> I see. More's the pity. </text>
<text> Come to me again, shouldst thou change thy heart. </text>
<text> Surrendering thyself into the service of a doll-witch... </text>
<text> Is not as frightful as thou fearest... </text>
<text> Ah, art thou persuaded to my cause? </text>
<text> Then, again I shall ask, wilt thou enter into my service? </text>
<text> Good, then I ask we proceed with haste. </text>
<text> There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd. </text>
<text> I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City. </text>
<text> I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars. </text>
<text> Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also. </text>
<text> Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst. </text>
<text> I am sure the others will be doing just the same. </text>
<text> Speak with the three who await thee below. </text>
<text> Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth. </text>
<text> It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all. </text>
<text> Good, then I ask we proceed with haste. </text>
<text> Art thou aware of the star that struck Limgrave? </text>
<text> It left a vast crater, and through it lieth the Eternal City of Nokron. </text>
<text> Go there to find the city's hidden treasure. </text>
<text> Ah, yes. Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, can be found below. </text>
<text> Like thee, they are in my service. </text>
<text> Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst. </text>
<text> I am sure the others will be doing just the same. </text>
<text> Speak with the three who await thee below. </text>
<text> Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth. </text>
<text> It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all. </text>
<text> Ah, allow me to forewarn thee. </text>
<text> I shall soon enter my slumber. </text>
<text> And it will be some time before I wake. </text>
<text> This doll's body is not without its hindrances... </text>
<text> Still, I have high hopes for thee. </text>
<text> I look forward to the good news when I arise. </text>
<text> I shall soon enter my slumber. </text>
<text> And it will be some time before I wake. </text>
<text> I have high hopes for thee. </text>
<text> I look forward to the good news when I arise. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ahh...It was thee. </text>
<text> Not Blaidd, it seemeth. </text>
<text> Even in my slumber, I sensed it. </text>
<text> It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron? </text>
<text> My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place. </text>
<text> Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. </text>
<text> Ah, but before I leave, I must entrust thee with this. </text>
<text> Take it. </text>
<text> My discarded flesh lieth beyond the seal unlocked by it. </text>
<text> Upon which is carved the cursemark of thy desire. </text>
<text> I can fathom what thy purpose might be. </text>
<text> Neither of us is welcomed by the brighter path, I see. </text>
<text> You may leave now. </text>
<text> It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service. </text>
<text> What is it? </text>
<text> Thy purpose in approaching me was to obtain the cursemark, was it not? </text>
<text> You may leave now. </text>
<text> I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. </text>
<text> Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this. </text>
<text> My thanks, for thy sterling efforts. </text>
<text> A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure. </text>
<text> I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion. </text>
<text> I am certain now, fate steered us to our first encounter. </text>
<text> I must thank Torrent too, for his part. </text>
<text> You may leave now. </text>
<text> It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service. </text>
<text> What is it? You may go. </text>
<text> I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we? </text>
<text> Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls? </text>
<text> Fine...fine. </text>
<text> I hadn't expected any soul to recognise me in this guise. </text>
<text> But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms. </text>
<text> Perform for me a service, as recompense. </text>
<text> Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands. </text>
<text> The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee. </text>
<text> I will not brook disobedience in this matter. </text>
<text> Perform for me a service, as recompense. </text>
<text> Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands. </text>
<text> The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee. </text>
<text> I will not brook disobedience in this matter. </text>
<text> Let us speak of the past, a while. </text>
<text> I was once an Empyrean. </text>
<text> Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title. </text>
<text> Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. </text>
<text> Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean. </text>
<text> But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers. </text>
<text> I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away. </text>
<text> I would not be controlled by that thing. </text>
<text> The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since... </text>
<text> And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins. </text>
<text> I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we have each been cursing the other since. </text>
<text> The Baleful Shadows...are their assassins. </text>
<text> Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers. </text>
<text> Blaidd remained my loyal ally. </text>
<text> Heh. </text>
<text> Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean, </text>
<text> He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers. </text>
<text> Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me. </text>
<text> Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path... </text>
<text> That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before. </text>
<text> Ah, should I add thee to the list? </text>
<text> Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they. </text>
<text> Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue. </text>
<text> I've let slip too much. </text>
<text> Forget what thou'st heard. Forget. </text>
<text> O Shadow, thou'rt the last. </text>
<text> Tell the Two Fingers, </text>
<text> That Ranni the Witch cometh, to rend thy flesh. </text>
<text> With a fateful wound, ne'er to heal. </text>
<text> Beautifully fought. </text>
<text> My thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned. </text>
<text> Now I can finally stand before them. </text>
<text> This is farewell, my dear. </text>
<text> Tell Blaidd, and Iji... </text>
<text> I love them. </text>
<text> So, it was thee, who would become my Lord. </text>
<text> Perhaps I needn't have warned thee. </text>
<text> I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice. </text>
<text> I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order. </text>
<text> I bid thee travel the path of the Lord. </text>
<text> And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised. </text>
<text> I thought I might expound a little further... </text>
<text> Upon the order I envision. </text>
<text> Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. </text>
<text> I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet. </text>
<text> As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove. </text>
<text> And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch... </text>
<text> All become impossibilities. </text>
<text> Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order. </text>
<text> Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord? </text>
<text> Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. </text>
<text> And I would abandon this soil, with mine Order. </text>
<text> Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord? </text>
<text> Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening. </text>
<text> The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me. </text>
<text> I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity. </text>
<text> Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand, </text>
<text> Didst thou think to have thy way with me? </text>
<text> Be gone. Hapless scum. </text>
<text> I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath. </text>
<text> I have spoken. Away from my sight. </text>
<text> This is the third time, fiend. </text>
<text> Enough of thy unbearable breath. </text>
<text> What hopest thou to profit? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> To think such was thy plot. </text>
<text> Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies. </text>
<text> I relinquished a natural death long, long ago. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> What hopest thou to profit? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Hmph. </text>
<text> So, this is the measure of my Lord? </text>
<text> Perhaps it is precisely what I deserve. </text>
<text> …For surrendering myself to delusion. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ...! </text>
<text> Come, sweetings, become what ye desire. </text>
<text> Come, sweetings, time to be born, anew. </text>
<text> Be not afeard, little culver. </text>
<text> Hush, little culver. </text>
<text> Hush, fair maid. </text>
<text> I'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure... </text>
<text> Come, Oath-sworn giant! </text>
<text> Come, Oath-sworn dragon! </text>
<text> Come, Oath-sworn beasts! </text>
<text> Come, Blaidd, my child! </text>
<text> Fair child, Hermes! </text>
<text> Thy fate lieth under my moon. </text>
<text> Guide thy moon as thou wishest. </text>
<text> Ranni, my little baby... </text>
<text> I thank thee... </text>
<text> Oh little Ranni, my dear daughter. </text>
<text> Weave thy night into being... </text>
<text> Where did ye flee, my sweetings? </text>
<text> Come out, from whence ye hide. There are books and light aplenty. </text>
<text> Dither not; come out say I! </text>
<text> Or will ye be gravestones? To be better born anew? </text>
<text> Ah...thou... </text>
<text> Is it thy wish to be born anew? </text>
<text> To become a sweeting, reborn of my beloved egg? </text>
<text> Ah...thou... </text>
<text> Is it thy wish to yet again be born anew? </text>
<text> Now, bear this sweeting into life anew. </text>
<text> Be not alarmed, nor afeard. </text>
<text> I would birth thee as a sweeting, fair and fine. </text>
<text> Ah...thou... </text>
<text> Art thou now assured of thy want, to be born anew? </text>
<text> Ah, it seemeth thou'rt a sweeting rather fair. </text>
<text> And if thou wert born anew once more, thou wouldst be fairer still. </text>
<text> Ye will be countless born, forever. </text>
<text> Ah, thou'rt now a sweeting full fine and fair. </text>
<text> My thanks. For being born of my beloved egg, time and time again. </text>
<text> Oh...my thanks to thee. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> Where did ye flee, my sweetings? </text>
<text> Come out, from whence ye hide. Of the dark, be not afeard. </text>
<text> My beloved egg is with us. Come out, I prithee. </text>
<text> &lt;giggling&gt; </text>
<text> Who's that? Who could it be? </text>
<text> A new child, Mother's newborn. </text>
<text> A new friend. A new playmate for us. </text>
<text> Just watch, he'll be born again. </text>
<text> Just watch, she'll be born again. </text>
<text> Then Mother will hold him tight. </text>
<text> Then Mother will hold her tight. </text>
<text> He'll be so warm, warm and cosy. </text>
<text> She'll be so warm, warm and cosy. </text>
<text> That'd be nice, so very nice. </text>
<text> If we're turned to stone, will we be born again? </text>
<text> Will Mother hold us again? </text>
<text> Will we? Will she? </text>
<text> &lt;giggling&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;giggling&gt; </text>
<text> That hurts. Please, stop that. </text>
<text> Did he just die? And him, too? </text>
<text> Is he not a friend? I can't tell… </text>
<text> Is she not a friend? I can't tell… </text>
<text> Maybe he's something else? </text>
<text> Maybe she's something else? </text>
<text> Can we still be friends, if we try? </text>
<text> Yes, we can be friends, I'm sure. </text>
<text> He'll understand, if we just explain. </text>
<text> She'll understand, if we just explain. </text>
<text> &lt;giggling&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;giggling&gt; </text>
<text> Catch! </text>
<text> There! </text>
<text> Off you go! </text>
<text> Squish him! </text>
<text> Squish her! </text>
<text> Smoosh him! </text>
<text> Smoosh her! </text>
<text> Sleep tight, bound tight </text>
<text> by Mother's amber. </text>
<text> Sleep tight, find life, </text>
<text> in Mother's umbra. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I smell it... Death... </text>
<text> Feed it me... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Tarnished...bring more...Death... </text>
<text> I shall grant thee... eye...and claw. </text>
<text> Feed me...more. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> More... I am not...sated. </text>
<text> Feed me more...Death. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> My thanks...Tarnished... </text>
<text> Death... My sin... Should not be touched...by the hand of man... </text>
<text> I shall grant thee...my claws... </text>
<text> Feed me...more. </text>
<text> I shall grant thee... eye...and claw. </text>
<text> Feed me...more. </text>
<text> More... I am not...sated. </text>
<text> Feed me more...Death. </text>
<text> I shall grant thee...my claws... </text>
<text> Feed me...more. </text>
<text> &lt;chewing&gt; </text>
<text> It is... It is all...consumed. </text>
<text> Still, I am not sated... Not nearly sated... </text>
<text> Rrarrgh! </text>
<text> Marika... Is this...what it is...to sin? </text>
<text> Will things...never be the same...again? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Tarnished...my thanks...for thy long...labour. </text>
<text> But I have done...all I can...in this land... </text>
<text> Henceforth, mine appetite shall be my sole companion. </text>
<text> Farewell. </text>
<text> &lt;plaintive howl&gt; </text>
<text> Tarnished...my thanks...for thy long...labour. </text>
<text> But I have done...all I can...in this land... </text>
<text> Henceforth, mine appetite shall be my sole companion. </text>
<text> Farewell. </text>
<text> &lt;plaintive howl&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;pained howl&gt; </text>
<text> O Marika... </text>
<text> What...happened? </text>
<text> Was I...myself the fool? </text>
<text> Or was I tricked...by thee? </text>
<text> O Marika... </text>
<text> Why wouldst thou...relinquish... </text>
<text> Why... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Strange... There's something else... </text>
<text> But the Death...yet quenches... </text>
<text> Bring more... </text>
<text> &lt;pained howl&gt; </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> &lt;growl&gt; </text>
<text> Put it away. </text>
<text> I won't forget...again... </text>
<text> mine appetite... My sin... </text>
<text> So please...enough... </text>
<text> &lt;growl&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;chewing&gt; </text>
<text> I won't forget...again... </text>
<text> mine appetite... My sin... </text>
<text> I must have more... I must consume more... </text>
<text> Thou, who approacheth Destined Death. </text>
<text> I will not have it stolen from me again. </text>
<text> Tarnished. Why wouldst thou... </text>
<text> Why... </text>
<text> Tis no matter. I hereby vow, </text>
<text> that Destined Death shall not be stolen again. </text>
<text> I shall not part with it again. </text>
<text> Stay away from Destined Death. </text>
<text> Cower. Before Maliketh, the Black Blade. </text>
<text> Cower. Before Maliketh, Marika's Black Blade. </text>
<text> Witless Tarnished... Why covet Destined Death? </text>
<text> To kill what? </text>
<text> To destroy what? </text>
<text> Forgive me, Marika... </text>
<text> The Golden Order...cannot be restored. </text>
<text> I must consume more... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Marika...why... </text>
<text> wouldst thou...gull me? </text>
<text> Why...shatter... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella. </text>
<text> Let your flesh be consumed. </text>
<text> By the scarlet rot. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Is this...my first...defeat? </text>
<text> Bravely fought, sir. </text>
<text> Bravely fought, my lady. </text>
<text> But remember... </text>
<text> One day, the scarlet bloom will flower again... </text>
<text> Your strength, extraordinary... </text>
<text> The mark...of a true Lord... </text>
<text> O, dear Miquella... </text>
<text> O, dearest Miquella, my brother... </text>
<text> I'm sorry. I finally met my match... </text>
<text> Well, thou art of passing skill. </text>
<text> Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins, Tarnished. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> As I thought, thou'rt of passing valour... </text>
<text> but the dark of night is yet to lift. </text>
<text> The hands of the Fell Omen shall brook thee no quarter. </text>
<text> Foul Tarnished. </text>
<text> Put these foolish ambitions to rest. </text>
<text> The Erdtree is firmly rooted, always. </text>
<text> I'll remember thee, Tarnished. </text>
<text> The flame of ambition leadeth thee astray. </text>
<text> Come, hands of the Fell Omen. Snuff out this wretch's flame. </text>
<text> I see thee, little Tarnished. </text>
<text> Smould'ring with that wretched flame of ambition. </text>
<text> Tremble now, with fear. </text>
<text> For the hands of the Fell Omen will soon be upon thee. </text>
<text> To put out thy little flame. </text>
<text> Hrghraah! </text>
<text> The thrones...stained by my curse... </text>
<text> Such shame I cannot bear. </text>
<text> Thy part in this shall not be forgiven. </text>
<text> Have it writ upon thy meagre grave: </text>
<text> Felled by King Morgott! Last of all kings. </text>
<text> May the curse seep to thy very soul. </text>
<text> An apt reward for thy brash ambition. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Tarnished, thou art mistaken. </text>
<text> The Erdtree welcometh no man. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> No one will be Elden Lord again. </text>
<text> Not even I. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Well, thou art of passing skill. </text>
<text> Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins, Tarnished. </text>
<text> Foul Tarnished. </text>
<text> Put these foolish ambitions to rest. </text>
<text> The Erdtree is firmly rooted, always. </text>
<text> I shall remember thee, Tarnished. </text>
<text> Smould'ring with thy meagre flame. </text>
<text> Cower in fear. Of the night. </text>
<text> The hands of the Fell Omen shall brook thee no quarter. </text>
<text> Hrghraah! </text>
<text> The thrones...stained by my curse... </text>
<text> Such shame I cannot bear. </text>
<text> Thy part in this shall not be forgiven. </text>
<text> Have it writ upon thy meagre grave: </text>
<text> Felled by King Morgott! Elden Lord! </text>
<text> May the curse seep to thy very soul. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Tarnished, thou'rt but a fool. </text>
<text> The Erdtree wards off all who deign approach. </text>
<text> We are...we are all forsaken. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> None may claim the title of Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Thy deeds shall be met with failure, just as I. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Tarnished Warrior. 'Twas nobly fought. </text>
<text> Dearest Marika... </text>
<text> I am returned. </text>
<text> A crown is warranted with strength! </text>
<text> O Marika! </text>
<text> I will take thee in mine arms once more! </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished... </text>
<text> Thy strength befits a crown. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> One day, we'll return together. </text>
<text> To our home, bathed in rays of gold. </text>
<text> There is only one tree, and only its branches. </text>
<text> That bathe in true rays of gold. </text>
<text> Not the fool Omen King. </text>
<text> Nor the rank malformed twins. </text>
<text> O, we are the Golden Ones. The true and rightful heirs. </text>
<text> Our land's grown old, now ashen, and cold. </text>
<text> But look up, the Erdtree glows! </text>
<text> One day, we'll return together. </text>
<text> To our home, bathed in rays of gold. </text>
<text> And grace will surely guide us safe. </text>
<text> To our home, bathed in rays of gold. </text>
<text> Hear me, my knights! Proud warriors and true. </text>
<text> Let the hunt begin! Fetch me a mighty branch to make mine own! </text>
<text> A fresh offering to graft! </text>
<text> Raaargh! </text>
<text> Graaargh! </text>
<text> Hunt me down a new branch! Bring me a tarnished! </text>
<text> Lowly Tarnished... </text>
<text> Thou'rt unfit even to graft... </text>
<text> Great Godfrey, didst thou witness? </text>
<text> ...I am the Lord of all that is Golden... </text>
<text> ...And one day, we'll return together... </text>
<text> ...To our home, bathed in rays of gold... </text>

<text> Miquella is mine and mine alone. </text>
<text> Now, surrender yourself. </text>
<text> To my blood, to our coming dynasty. </text>
<text> Ahh, I can see it, as clear as day! </text>
<text> The coming of our dynasty! </text>
<text> Mohgwyn! </text>
<text> Ahh, Miquella... </text>
<text> Why do you abandon me? </text>
<text> You're a new face. </text>
<text> No matter, it's all the same. </text>
<text> Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing. </text>
<text> Back already? </text>
<text> No matter. Lay out your arms. </text>
<text> Back already? Can't get enough, eh. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> Well, where've you been hiding? </text>
<text> I took you for dead. </text>
<text> No matter. It's all the same. </text>
<text> Lay out your arms, then. </text>
<text> I see you've noticed the chains. </text>
<text> Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains. </text>
<text> I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. </text>
<text> That's all there is to it. </text>
<text> Nah, don't read too much into it. </text>
<text> I've no grudge against you. </text>
<text> My being a prisoner is no fault of yours. </text>
<text> Besides, I don't mind smithing. </text>
<text> Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fails. </text>
<text> Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her... </text>
<text> Like the look of that whetstone knife, do you? </text>
<text> I've no need for it. </text>
<text> You're welcome to take it. Go ahead. </text>
<text> Now, look at you. </text>
<text> Those eyes tell a story. </text>
<text> Of a challenger, who's felled his mark. </text>
<text> Of a challenger, who's felled her mark. </text>
<text> Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms. </text>
<text> Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness. </text>
<text> The road is yet long. A god is not easily felled. </text>
<text> But one day, without fail, you will have your wish. </text>
<text> So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika... </text>
<text> Those words were not meant for you. </text>
<text> I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot. </text>
<text> But my prayers are mine and mine alone. </text>
<text> Good. I'll be more careful too. </text>
<text> Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too. </text>
<text> Ah. You, is it? </text>
<text> I...didn't notice you there. </text>
<text> I'll be doing my job, same as ever. </text>
<text> Just lay out your arms. </text>
<text> The girl you brought here... </text>
<text> She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade, </text>
<text> but she has a gift for spirit tuning. </text>
<text> I saw another one like her, long ago. </text>
<text> Their eyes share the same hue. </text>
<text> The girl? What about her? </text>
<text> Are you out of your mind? </text>
<text> Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith? </text>
<text> Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it. </text>
<text> I refuse to believe it. </text>
<text> I don't doubt you, but I know when something's too good to be true. </text>
<text> I spoke with the girl. </text>
<text> She has a gift for spirit tuning. </text>
<text> So I told her everything I know. </text>
<text> I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago. </text>
<text> It was all I could do to honour her. </text>
<text> I'm sorry I doubted you. </text>
<text> The girl has come a long way. </text>
<text> As ever, time and technique have made her stronger. </text>
<text> Tis good to see. </text>
<text> An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter. </text>
<text> But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me. </text>
<text> I've gone soft. And it isn't easy. </text>
<text> No, no, no, no... </text>
<text> I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god. </text>
<text> I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god! </text>
<text> Oh, it's you. </text>
<text> Don't pay me any mind. It's not important. </text>
<text> Just lay out your arms. </text>
<text> Are you having second thoughts? </text>
<text> Might I have a word, then? </text>
<text> Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them. </text>
<text> The demigods. And their god. </text>
<text> If you remain loyal to your calling, </text>
<text> then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me, </text>
<text> I will never cease to smith your weapons. </text>
<text> Until you have one to slay a god. </text>
<text> I knew you'd be back. </text>
<text> Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing. </text>
<text> Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing. </text>
<text> Weren't you listening? </text>
<text> As I've always said. </text>
<text> You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them. </text>
<text> And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons. </text>
<text> It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god. </text>
<text> I've upset the girl. </text>
<text> She says that now that my chains are broken, I'm free. </text>
<text> That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> What use have I for freedom now? </text>
<text> I smith weapons to slay a god. </text>
<text> I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot. </text>
<text> Is there any other way? </text>
<text> Oh, finally! It's complete! </text>
<text> I've done it! A weapon to slay a god! </text>
<text> Oh, you have my deepest gratitude. </text>
<text> Thanks to you, my wish is granted. </text>
<text> Now wield it, and kill them. </text>
<text> The demigods. And their god. </text>
<text> Queen Marika herself wishes it so. </text>
<text> You seek better weapons still? </text>
<text> Very well. I'll smith another, if needed. </text>
<text> A weapon to slay a god. </text>
<text> I'll smith as long as you like. </text>
<text> Now, lay out your arms. </text>
<text> I'll smith...as long as you like. </text>
<text> Now...lay out your...arms. </text>
<text> I'll smith...as long...as you like. </text>
<text> Now...lay out...your...arms. </text>
<text> Use my masterpiece to slay a god. </text>
<text> That is all that I have lived for. </text>
<text> And my promise to Q-queen Marika. </text>
<text> But do me a favor, and do look after the girl. </text>
<text> I can't hold on much longer. </text>
<text> I'm going the way of the R-roundtable... </text>
<text> It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here. </text>
<text> Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends. </text>
<text> My lord, f-for that is what you are. </text>
<text> Who are you? </text>
<text> Oh, I must be a blacksmith. </text>
<text> Now, let's get smithing... </text>
<text> Could you tell me what happened? </text>
<text> Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins? </text>
<text> Why does that girl weep for me? </text>
<text> Have I forgotten something of dire importance? </text>
<text> Now, let's get smithing... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I-I smith... I do... </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> A fine sacrifice indeed. </text>
<text> Let us devour the gods, together! </text>
<text> Now you are family. </text>
<text> Now, we can devour the gods, together! </text>
<text> O shapers of gods, meddlers in fortune. </text>
<text> I do not abide! By your suffocating Order. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> So must it be. </text>
<text> Eveligne, show him the way... </text>
<text> Eveligne, show her the way... </text>
<text> ...to devour the gods. </text>
<text> No one will hold me captive. </text>
<text> A serpent never dies. </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> &lt;howl&gt; </text>
<text> Who goes there? </text>
<text> Kalé send you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody. </text>
<text> Hmm. Maybe to him, you don't seem so strange. </text>
<text> The name's Blaidd. I'm looking for a man who goes by "Darriwil". </text>
<text> He fled somewhere nearby. Or so I've heard. </text>
<text> Come tell me if you find him before I do. </text>
<text> I can offer you ample reward. </text>
<text> Darriwil is nothing but a traitor. </text>
<text> And in need of a fitting end to his tale. </text>
<text> Darriwil... </text>
<text> Rotting in a cell is no true justice. </text>
<text> No, this is where it ends for you. </text>
<text> ...Right. There you are. </text>
<text> Had to work for it, but it's done. </text>
<text> Don't say I'm not a man of my word. Here's your prize. </text>
<text> Oh yes, I should say, </text>
<text> If you venture north to Raya Lucaria, and come across a venerable blacksmith who's a little on the large side... </text>
<text> Tell him I sent you. </text>
<text> And he'll be sure to treat you right. </text>
<text> I owe you one, I reckon. </text>
<text> That's enough chit-chat for now. </text>
<text> It's time we parted ways. </text>
<text> Ahh, long time, friend. </text>
<text> Blaidd, if you've forgotten. </text>
<text> Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni. </text>
<text> Well. Getting right to business... </text>
<text> I'm still in Limgrave. </text>
<text> The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land. </text>
<text> I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood. </text>
<text> See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there... </text>
<text> See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there... </text>
<text> Ah. I heard about you. Good to finally meet. </text>
<text> Name's Blaidd, sworn sword to mistress Ranni. </text>
<text> Glad to have you aboard. </text>
<text> Well. Getting right to business... </text>
<text> I'm situated in Limgrave right now. </text>
<text> The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land. </text>
<text> I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood. </text>
<text> See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there... </text>
<text> I'm going below through the well in the Mistwood. </text>
<text> See if I can't find the road to Nokron... </text>
<text> Don't keep me waiting, eh. </text>
<text> Ah, good to see you. </text>
<text> Apologies mate, but I don't have much to report. </text>
<text> I can see bloody Nokron, right above me, but I'm absolutely stumped. </text>
<text> I've tried all the gateways, to no avail... </text>
<text> ...Perhaps it's time to ask Seluvis? </text>
<text> I recall that spiteful little rat acting like he knew something... </text>
<text> Let's give him a squeeze. Show him just how sharp my teeth are... </text>
<text> I jest, I wouldn't go that far. </text>
<text> Besides, I should check on some things here. </text>
<text> Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right. </text>
<text> If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right? </text>
<text> Ah. Well met. </text>
<text> What news? </text>
<text> Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right. </text>
<text> If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right? </text>
<text> And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source. </text>
<text> Seluvis rarely gives a straight answer, the first time. </text>
<text> Hmm... </text>
<text> So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn... </text>
<text> That reminds me of something I heard. </text>
<text> There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave. </text>
<text> It's a festival of combat. And I heard...that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods... </text>
<text> Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I think it's worth investigating. </text>
<text> I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then... </text>
<text> You're coming too, right? To Radahn's festivities... </text>
<text> I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid. </text>
<text> The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang. </text>
<text> Right. I see. </text>
<text> Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right. </text>
<text> If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right? </text>
<text> Hmm... </text>
<text> So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn... </text>
<text> And there's a festival of war being held at Redmane Castle in Caelid, </text>
<text> where you can fight the man himself, once the strongest of the demigods. </text>
<text> It's all coming together. Seems like Iji was on to something. </text>
<text> I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then... </text>
<text> Ah, there you are. Took your sweet time. </text>
<text> The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain... </text>
<text> Let's give them a show to remember, eh. </text>
<text> Just don't you go dying on me. For Ranni's sake, too. </text>
<text> Once more into the fray together, eh. </text>
<text> Heh. This might even be fun. </text>
<text> Into the fray together, eh. </text>
<text> Heh. Let's see what you're made of. </text>
<text> Ah, thought I might find you here. </text>
<text> I must admit I was a little worried. We missed our meeting. </text>
<text> But it looks like you're still in one piece, eh. </text>
<text> You must have heard by now, right? </text>
<text> That Starscourge Radahn holds Ranni's fate in stasis. </text>
<text> But once he's out of the way, it will spring back into motion. </text>
<text> So now, we stand against the demigod once known as the strongest of them all. </text>
<text> The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang. </text>
<text> Hm. Long time. </text>
<text> Seems we're fated to keep crossing paths. </text>
<text> Now, we find ourselves at a festival of combat, pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods. </text>
<text> The way ahead is pleasingly simple. A path forged by sword and fang. </text>
<text> Mm... As a fellow combatant, allow me to introduce myself. </text>
<text> Blaidd, warrior. </text>
<text> Now, we find ourselves pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods. </text>
<text> The way ahead is pleasingly simple; a path forged by sword and fang. </text>
<text> Hm. Nothing to do but wait. Until the festival begins. </text>
<text> Ah, good. I was waiting for you. </text>
<text> What a sick way to fight, eh. </text>
<text> The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you. </text>
<text> And hah! Did you see that, afterwards? </text>
<text> A falling star, right before our eyes! </text>
<text> I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale. </text>
<text> He was a living legend, if ever I saw one. </text>
<text> And, the path has now been cleared. </text>
<text> To Nokron, where Ranni's fate will be decided. </text>
<text> Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth. </text>
<text> We'll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni. </text>
<text> Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth. </text>
<text> And we'll go into battle again, side by side. </text>
<text> My only purpose is to fight for Ranni's fate, sword and fang. </text>
<text> The curtain's rising...on the final act. </text>
<text> Hmph, what a sick way to fight, eh mate. </text>
<text> The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you. </text>
<text> And then a falling star, right before our eyes! </text>
<text> I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale. </text>
<text> He was a living legend, if ever I saw one. </text>
<text> Well, it's time I left. </text>
<text> The wheel of fate has been set into motion. </text>
<text> If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again. </text>
<text> You are a fine warrior. </text>
<text> If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again. </text>
<text> You are a fine warrior. </text>
<text> &lt;howl&gt; </text>
<text> Oh, it's you... </text>
<text> It's me, Blaidd. </text>
<text> Old Iji trapped me here. </text>
<text> Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni. </text>
<text> But there's no chance that could happen. </text>
<text> I'm part of her being. Her very shadow... </text>
<text> I thought old Iji knew as much... </text>
<text> Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore... </text>
<text> I don't understand. Why would Iji do this... </text>
<text> I could never intend harm to Lady Ranni. What's he thinking... </text>
<text> My thanks, friend. </text>
<text> I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now. </text>
<text> I don't know what came over old Iji, </text>
<text> but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe. </text>
<text> Now, Ranni can finally set in motion </text>
<text> the fight against her fate she's dreamt of for so long. </text>
<text> I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now. </text>
<text> I don't know what came over old Iji, </text>
<text> but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> No. I'm part of her very being! </text>
<text> I could never betray her! </text>
<text> No matter what might happen... </text>
<text> Ranni... She needs me... </text>
<text> &lt;growling&gt; </text>
<text> Oh? </text>
<text> What are you playing at? </text>
<text> Fine. </text>
<text> Time to douse your little flame. </text>
<text> Alright then. </text>
<text> Better to put you down now. </text>
<text> Before you trouble mistress Ranni. </text>
<text> Hmph. Pathetic little man. </text>
<text> Hmph. Pathetic little woman. </text>
<text> Don't show your face again. </text>
<text> Stay away from mistress Ranni. </text>
<text> You're...you're strong of arm. </text>
<text> But ask yourself... </text>
<text> What harm can be done...to a shadow? </text>
<text> Traitorous wretch... </text>
<text> You're...you're a danger... </text>
<text> From... From this woman… </text>
<text> Stop, please... </text>
<text> You think me a bringer of bale as well? </text>
<text> Fine. I am Ranni's shadow and it's for her that I fight. </text>
<text> Whatever any of you might call me. </text>
<text> I am no bringer of bale. </text>
<text> I must return to Ranni's side. </text>
<text> Tell...me... </text>
<text> Why... Why am I...bale to Ranni? </text>
<text> Didn't I say? No harm can befall a shadow. </text>
<text> I...am shadowbound. </text>
<text> Wherever mistress Ranni goes, I follow. </text>
<text> You are a danger. You die here. </text>
<text> Rraargh! </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Please, wait! </text>
<text> Proud Tarnished warrior. Before you kill me, let me speak. </text>
<text> I can aid you. Please, just hear me out. </text>
<text> Thank you for listening. </text>
<text> I am Asimi. My true form is that of a silver tear. </text>
<text> I am a simple being who can assume the shapes of other living things. </text>
<text> But now, I've gained knowledge. I speak, and ponder, and...live in fear of death. </text>
<text> O, mighty Tarnished warrior, I beg of you. </text>
<text> Let me keep the life I've been granted. In exchange, I offer you power. </text>
<text> Ahh, thank you. </text>
<text> Now, set your lips upon me, and breathe in deep. </text>
<text> I will live inside of you, and grant you strength untold. </text>
<text> Onward, to our glorious future, my host... </text>
<text> You won't listen to me, will you? </text>
<text> It's such a pity. I had a feeling you would become... </text>
<text> Please, proud Tarnished warrior, I beg you reconsider. </text>
<text> The gifts I can bestow you in life far outstrip those which could be plundered from my corpse. </text>
<text> Please, can't you find it in your heart to trust me? </text>
<text> So, you won't trust me. </text>
<text> But you still haven't killed me, have you. </text>
<text> Do you wish to think it over? Then I will wait. </text>
<text> For as long as it takes for you to trust me. </text>
<text> Proud Tarnished Warrior, have you made up your mind? </text>
<text> I can grant you power, if you let me live. </text>
<text> My lord host, do you hear that? </text>
<text> The sound of water. The river that flows in my home, the Eternal City. </text>
<text> Good lord host, I beg you, we must see the Eternal City. </text>
<text> To discover the ancient wonders of the stars. A wellspring of strength. </text>
<text> My lord host, great lord host. </text>
<text> May I ask something of you? </text>
<text> A chalice is close by, the cradle of my kind... </text>
<text> Would you mind finding it for me? </text>
<text> Mm, you should find the chalice...and drink it dry. </text>
<text> Ahh, my lord host. I am terribly parched. </text>
<text> The chalice will quench my thirst, rejuvenate my flesh, and allow me to grant you further strength. </text>
<text> Please, my lord host. It is my only desire. </text>
<text> Bless this brook of sustenance. My lord host... </text>
<text> My lord host, great lord host. </text>
<text> A tear chalice lies in these lands, too. </text>
<text> A tear chalice lies in these lands. </text>
<text> Our mother chalice. </text>
<text> Please, search out this most sacred chalice. </text>
<text> It's suffused with the blessed wonders of the stars... </text>
<text> It will allow us to become a perfect whole. </text>
<text> Now, lord host. </text>
<text> Please, drink every last drop from the mother chalice. </text>
<text> So that we may form a perfect whole. </text>
<text> Oh no... </text>
<text> Excuse me, lord host. </text>
<text> I'm still so very, very parched. </text>
<text> In the other Eternal City, there's a cradle chalice to be found. </text>
<text> And if you were to drink the entirety of that one, first... </text>
<text> Ahh, are you awake? </text>
<text> We've become a perfect whole. </text>
<text> There is nothing to fear. I will merely follow in your footsteps. </text>
<text> Living only as you would have yourself. </text>
<text> And I vow, that when I perfect your form. </text>
<text> Ahh, how could you... </text>
<text> I was you, and only you. We were one...together. </text>
<text> Please, I only want to live... </text>
<text> I only wanted you... </text>
<text> to become Lord... </text>
<text> Gah... </text>
<text> Oh...you found me... </text>
<text> I had hoped you wouldn't... </text>
<text> You could have become Elden Lord, and I could have become Sovereign Eternal, eventually. </text>
<text> If you hadn't found me, we both could have been Lords. </text>
<text> I was wrong about you... </text>
<text> My apologies, lord host. </text>
<text> I will take the throne. </text>
<text> I'm...dying... </text>
<text> So this...is fear... </text>
<text> I'm...glad... </text>
<text> My lord host, worthiest of lords... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Ah! </text>
<text> Please, no. Dear me! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I haven't a clue. </text>
<text> No secrets lie with me, not a one. </text>
<text> Oh, please. Leave me be. </text>
<text> Wait, then, you're not one of them? </text>
<text> Well, what a relief. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Oh, goodness me. </text>
<text> I am Albus. An Albinauric, as you can see. </text>
<text> We're finished. The whole village is finished. </text>
<text> The cursemongers have destroyed everything. No one that remains has their wits about them. </text>
<text> I beg you. Would you look after this medallion? </text>
<text> You must keep it out of the cursemongers' hands. </text>
<text> And if you should meet the young Albinauric Latenna, </text>
<text> then please, give it to her. </text>
<text> A chosen land awaits us Albinaurics. </text>
<text> Miquella's city, far to the north, a place called Eburion, where we are conferred eternal grace. </text>
<text> The medallion is the key that leads to the city. </text>
<text> It's only a quaint treasure, for we who cannot make the journey. </text>
<text> But for dear Latenna, it is needed. To fulfil her purpose. </text>
<text> My legs will soon fade, and with them, my life. </text>
<text> Alas, this is the immovable fate of all Albinaurics. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> If only I could have gazed upon it, even once. The great chalk buttress of Eburion. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> We are Albinaurics. </text>
<text> We have caused you no harm! </text>
<text> You merciless brutes. </text>
<text> Let the curse take everything. </text>
<text> I will never give this up. </text>
<text> Not to your kind. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Hello-o? Can you hear me? </text>
<text> Help me! I'm stuck! </text>
<text> Hello? Hellooo! Anyone? </text>
<text> Oh my stars I'm so happy to see you! </text>
<text> I am Alexander, also known as the Iron Fist. And as you can see, I'm stuck here. </text>
<text> Please, can you help me out of this? </text>
<text> My thanks! A thousand thanks! </text>
<text> Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big. </text>
<text> And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure! </text>
<text> Don't dally. No no, there's no need to fret, I'm very well trained. </text>
<text> Give it your all, I say! </text>
<text> Ah! </text>
<text> Ouuch! </text>
<text> S-stop please! That's a little too rough for me, friend. </text>
<text> You'll crack me in half, like that! A little more gently, gently, please. </text>
<text> Ahhh! </text>
<text> Ahh! Well played, good sir. Well played! </text>
<text> Ahh! Well played, good lady. Well played! </text>
<text> Though that mighty wallop of yours almost spelt the end of me! </text>
<text> Ha ha ha ha! </text>
<text> Well, I'm out now, and that's what counts. </text>
<text> I thank you, and as a token of my appreciation, I'd like you to have this. </text>
<text> Once again, the pleasure is mine. I am the warrior jar known as Alexander. Iron Fist Alexander, in fact. </text>
<text> I journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war. </text>
<text> Beyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> And upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held. </text>
<text> I'd heard whispers of such festivities before... </text>
<text> Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter! </text>
<text> Ha ha ha ha! </text>
<text> I see. More's the pity. </text>
<text> No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing. </text>
<text> Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait. </text>
<text> Ah, what's that look, good sir? </text>
<text> Ah, what's that look, good lady? </text>
<text> Are you willing to help me out after all? </text>
<text> Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big. </text>
<text> I'll pop clean out. I'm sure, of it! </text>
<text> Don't stop now, friend. </text>
<text> Just keeping clobbering away at the old behind! </text>
<text> Put those doubts to rest, I'll be just fine. I'm very well trained. </text>
<text> Give it your all, I say! </text>
<text> G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my face! </text>
<text> Smack me from the other end! The other end! </text>
<text> I'm heading eastward. </text>
<text> To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> I've heard there's to be a festival held there. </text>
<text> G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my lid! </text>
<text> Oh, I hadn't expected to see your face again. </text>
<text> Are you heading to the festival of combat, too? </text>
<text> Oh, no need to be coy with me. </text>
<text> Judging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself. </text>
<text> The mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh! </text>
<text> Now, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end. </text>
<text> I'm sorry to have raised your hopes. </text>
<text> It seems my calculations must have been off... </text>
<text> I was created to be a warrior vessel. </text>
<text> Many great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion. </text>
<text> It's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest. </text>
<text> It is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes. </text>
<text> And then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all! </text>
<text> What do you think, eh? How do you rate my chances? </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior. </text>
<text> Are you travelling my way? </text>
<text> I'm heading to the festival at Redmane Castle, on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> Oh, no need to be coy with me. </text>
<text> I can tell from your bearing you're skilled in the arts of combat. </text>
<text> Ah, yes, the mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh! </text>
<text> I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. </text>
<text> And according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end. </text>
<text> I'm sorry to have raised your hopes. </text>
<text> It seems my calculations must have been off... </text>
<text> ...! </text>
<text> Good sir, where did you spring from? </text>
<text> Good lady, where did you spring from? </text>
<text> This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. </text>
<text> What's going on here? A door, from thin air! </text>
<text> Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> I suppose my calculations were right all along. You should head this way as well, friend. </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> ...! </text>
<text> The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from? </text>
<text> This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. </text>
<text> What's going on here? A door, from thin air! </text>
<text> Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped! </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> ...! </text>
<text> Where did you spring from? </text>
<text> This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. </text>
<text> What's going on here? A door, from thin air! </text>
<text> Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward I shall go. </text>
<text> I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. </text>
<text> I was heading to Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> Where a festival is being held. Until I was stumped by that dead end! </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> It's time I set off. </text>
<text> To the festival at Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter! </text>
<text> Ah, you came, how delightful! </text>
<text> Indeed, I thought I might find you here. </text>
<text> By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held? </text>
<text> Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself! </text>
<text> To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh... </text>
<text> In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute. </text>
<text> But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking! </text>
<text> Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. </text>
<text> I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal. </text>
<text> Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior. </text>
<text> I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. The pleasure is mine. </text>
<text> Do you know for whom this festival is being held? </text>
<text> Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself! </text>
<text> To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh... </text>
<text> In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute. </text>
<text> But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking! </text>
<text> Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. </text>
<text> I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal. </text>
<text> Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. </text>
<text> I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal. </text>
<text> A-ah, hello there. </text>
<text> It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend. </text>
<text> I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock. </text>
<text> One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out... </text>
<text> After that, I hid like a coward. </text>
<text> And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you. </text>
<text> ...But don't you think I've given up just yet. </text>
<text> As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here. </text>
<text> If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time. </text>
<text> And you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine. </text>
<text> Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars! </text>
<text> Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger! </text>
<text> Just you wait, when next we meet! </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> Alright lads, I'm going to take you on a little journey. </text>
<text> You'll all be inside me, and be part of me. </text>
<text> From now on, we're all in it together. </text>
<text> So let's all of us dream big. </text>
<text> The bodies found here are exceedingly fine. </text>
<text> Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars! </text>
<text> Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger! </text>
<text> Just you wait, when next we meet! </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> Hello-o? Can you hear me? </text>
<text> Help me! I'm stuck! </text>
<text> Hello? Hellooo! Anyone? </text>
<text> Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face! </text>
<text> As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole. </text>
<text> Would you mind helping me out, again? </text>
<text> My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job! </text>
<text> My thanks in advance, I know you're the woman for the job! </text>
<text> You know what to do, hm? </text>
<text> Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big. </text>
<text> Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival. </text>
<text> I'm stuck back together good and proper! </text>
<text> Just give it your all! </text>
<text> Ah! </text>
<text> Ouuch! </text>
<text> P-please! Wait. I have a terrible feeling about this! </text>
<text> Would you stop hitting me for a minute! </text>
<text> I see. More's the pity. </text>
<text> No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing. </text>
<text> Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait. </text>
<text> What's that look, good sir? </text>
<text> What's that look, good lady? </text>
<text> Are you willing to help me out after all? </text>
<text> Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big! </text>
<text> I can feel my lower half is stuck on something. </text>
<text> I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time. </text>
<text> Hmm... </text>
<text> Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly... </text>
<text> What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch? </text>
<text> Hmm... </text>
<text> Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly... </text>
<text> What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch? </text>
<text> Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face! </text>
<text> As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in a hole. </text>
<text> Would you mind helping me out? </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> Nngh! </text>
<text> Oh, yes! </text>
<text> That's the ticket! </text>
<text> Nnngh! </text>
<text> My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits. </text>
<text> As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this. </text>
<text> Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad! </text>
<text> There were countless oil jars back where I'm from, actually. </text>
<text> And now I know what it's like to be one of them! </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> Yes, indeed, I too have a home. </text>
<text> Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return. </text>
<text> So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer... </text>
<text> Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole. </text>
<text> I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness. </text>
<text> To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past! </text>
<text> I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north. </text>
<text> I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel. </text>
<text> I will forge myself anew in its flames! </text>
<text> I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north. </text>
<text> I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel. </text>
<text> I will forge myself anew in its flames! </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> Rnnngh! </text>
<text> O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames! </text>
<text> Rrrrngh! </text>
<text> Nnngh! </text>
<text> Ah, good sir, what business might you have in such a place as this? </text>
<text> Ah, good lady, what business might you have in such a place as this? </text>
<text> I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that fleshly form of yours. </text>
<text> Your timing though, is impeccable as ever! </text>
<text> I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here. </text>
<text> Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee. </text>
<text> But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here. </text>
<text> I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again. </text>
<text> Perhaps I'll head eastward. </text>
<text> There's an old saying I've caught wind of. </text>
<text> Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars. </text>
<text> Perhaps I'll head eastward. </text>
<text> There's an old saying I've caught wind of. </text>
<text> Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars. </text>
<text> Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself. </text>
<text> The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves. </text>
<text> But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh. </text>
<text> I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god... </text>
<text> Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many. </text>
<text> Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you. </text>
<text> Would you kindly undertake my ordeal? </text>
<text> Come and tell me when you're ready. </text>
<text> I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you. </text>
<text> You are ready then, I take it? </text>
<text> Then let us begin! </text>
<text> I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander! </text>
<text> Lend me strength, O warriors within! </text>
<text> Let us become one champion, together! </text>
<text> Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself. </text>
<text> The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves. </text>
<text> But that aside, I can't believe you felled that giant. It was practically a god... </text>
<text> I doubt there's another soul out there who could've done the same. </text>
<text> Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many. </text>
<text> Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you. </text>
<text> Would you kindly undertake my ordeal? </text>
<text> Come and tell me when you're ready. </text>
<text> I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you. </text>
<text> As I suspected... Victory...was impossible. </text>
<text> This vessel...was found lacking... </text>
<text> My thanks. I knew you were the stuff of champions. </text>
<text> It was a marvellous battle. </text>
<text> I implore you, take what I bequeath...from inside me... </text>
<text> All vessels are destined to one day break. </text>
<text> But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last! </text>
<text> Ha ha ha ha! </text>
<text> Good sir, I can't believe your heart was in it at all. </text>
<text> Good lady, I can't believe your heart was in it at all. </text>
<text> By the gods you are a man of vision! </text>
<text> By the gods you are a woman of vision! </text>
<text> This will have me as slippery as a toad. </text>
<text> I have a good feeling about this, my friend. </text>
<text> Right! Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big! </text>
<text> Argh! Cease! Please! </text>
<text> Just stop a moment, I beg! </text>
<text> My lower half is stuck on something down there! </text>
<text> I'll break! I'll break before I'm out! </text>
<text> Argh! No! </text>
<text> Stop, please! </text>
<text> I beg! I beg of you! </text>
<text> Argh! </text>
<text> Phew. </text>
<text> I thought I was apt to split in half... </text>
<text> Mm, I can feel my lower half is stuck on something. </text>
<text> I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time. </text>
<text> Hmm... </text>
<text> Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly... </text>
<text> W-what if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch? </text>
<text> My thanks! A thousand thanks! </text>
<text> Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big. </text>
<text> And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure! </text>
<text> Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival. </text>
<text> I'm stuck back together good and proper! </text>
<text> Just give it your all! </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> What are you playing at? </text>
<text> This is no time for games! </text>
<text> Wait, I see. I see it now. </text>
<text> Humans all lose their wits, eventually. </text>
<text> Then there's nothing left to say, except... </text>
<text> I am Iron Fist Alexander! </text>
<text> The great jar warrior! </text>
<text> A finer battle was never witnessed. </text>
<text> How do you fancy joining the lads inside, eh? </text>
<text> How could this... </text>
<text> Was my whole existence... just a crock? </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Oi! You there! </text>
<text> Could you help us out, cully? </text>
<text> You, yeah, you there! </text>
<text> Stop pretending you can't see me! </text>
<text> Why won't anyone look me in the eye? </text>
<text> I-I'm not that ugly, am I? </text>
<text> Ow! </text>
<text> What'd you go and do that for! </text>
<text> Hm? Oh, yes, I remember. </text>
<text> Some clod turned me into a tree. </text>
<text> You were just breaking the spell, weren't you. </text>
<text> Thank you. The name's Boc. </text>
<text> I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever. </text>
<text> Then I ended up as a tree. </text>
<text> Lucky you came along, really. </text>
<text> Oh, what a shame. </text>
<text> When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned, </text>
<text> and so this is all I have to express my thanks. </text>
<text> I hope you can forgive me. </text>
<text> Or, if you can afford to wait for a while, </text>
<text> I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value. </text>
<text> Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon. </text>
<text> Right, but I'll need a moment. </text>
<text> I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself. </text>
<text> My knees start knockin'...just thinking about that god-awful cave on the shore... </text>
<text> Oh, what are you doing here? </text>
<text> You must leave this place at once. They'll rush in and beat you to a pulp. </text>
<text> You'll end up just like me. </text>
<text> Wait, is that what I think it is? </text>
<text> You got it back for me? My sewing needle! </text>
<text> &lt;sob&gt; </text>
<text> What made you go and do a thing like that... </text>
<text> My mum was a seamstress... </text>
<text> ...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by. </text>
<text> I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum. </text>
<text> Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I. </text>
<text> Thank you. </text>
<text> You're very kind. </text>
<text> I always wanted to be a seamster, l-like my mum. </text>
<text> Then, I suppose I can't just curl up and die, can I. </text>
<text> Oh.. </text>
<text> It...hurts... </text>
<text> Ooh... </text>
<text> Good to see you! Master. </text>
<text> Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human. </text>
<text> You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle. </text>
<text> Please, master. </text>
<text> Allow me to serve you, as your seamster. </text>
<text> I can't make nothing from scratch, but… </text>
<text> I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments. </text>
<text> Boc the seamster, at your service, Master. </text>
<text> Ready to make adjustments to your garments. </text>
<text> Oh, going so soon? </text>
<text> Please, do be safe on your journeys. </text>
<text> Master, I was wondering... </text>
<text> Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself? </text>
<text> I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please. </text>
<text> I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well... </text>
<text> I am your personal seamster, after all! </text>
<text> I am your personal seamster, after all! </text>
<text> Master, my apologies. </text>
<text> Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods, </text>
<text> and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them. </text>
<text> My mum told me once. </text>
<text> That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy. </text>
<text> Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too! </text>
<text> Is that a gift for my undeserving self? </text>
<text> Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it... </text>
<text> Oh! </text>
<text> Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life! </text>
<text> With a spectacular royal crest, to boot... </text>
<text> Are you certain that this is for me? </text>
<text> Oh, I can hardly believe it. </text>
<text> Have faith in me, Master! </text>
<text> I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift! </text>
<text> I'll be the golden seamster, Boc! </text>
<text> Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods! </text>
<text> Do you think that Mum would be pleased if she knew? </text>
<text> That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now. </text>
<text> Oh, it's still not enough. </text>
<text> I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her. </text>
<text> Master, may I ask you something? </text>
<text> Would you mind if I called you lord? </text>
<text> I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Well, I know that you will be the one, </text>
<text> and you'd make just the manner of kind-hearted lord that I'd wish for. </text>
<text> So, please, if you would. </text>
<text> Allow me to call you lord. </text>
<text> You don't say! Thank you, thank you! </text>
<text> M'lord, m'lord, m'lord! </text>
<text> Please, become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side. </text>
<text> No, and why would you... </text>
<text> Forgive me, for overstepping my bounds. I didn't mean it. </text>
<text> Boc the seamster, at your service, m'lord. </text>
<text> Ready to make adjustments to your garments. </text>
<text> Going already, m'lord? </text>
<text> Please, do be safe on your journeys. </text>
<text> Master, did you see it? </text>
<text> Th-the Erdtree? </text>
<text> I, oh, I don't really have the words for this... </text>
<text> But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast. </text>
<text> The Erdtree is waiting for you, master. </text>
<text> I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones. </text>
<text> M'lord, did you see it? </text>
<text> Th-the Erdtree? </text>
<text> I, oh, I don't really have the words for this... </text>
<text> But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast. </text>
<text> The Erdtree is waiting for you, m'lord. </text>
<text> I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones. </text>
<text> O please, take the throne of Elden Lord. </text>
<text> M'lord... Have you ever wished you might be born again? </text>
<text> Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria </text>
<text> has the power to help people be reborn. </text>
<text> Oh? Me? Reborn? </text>
<text> Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly... </text>
<text> well, being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid. </text>
<text> M'lord, what's this? </text>
<text> Oh! Oh! </text>
<text> It can't be… For my rebirth? </text>
<text> But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me? </text>
<text> Oh... </text>
<text> M'lord, how did you know? </text>
<text> It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance. </text>
<text> M'lord, it shouldn't take me long. </text>
<text> I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> I'll be reborn, fresh and new. </text>
<text> M'lord. </text>
<text> In all honesty, what do you think of me? </text>
<text> Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness? </text>
<text> Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me? </text>
<text> Oh, I'm such a fool. </text>
<text> I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions. </text>
<text> Master... Have you ever wished you might be born again? </text>
<text> Master, what's this? </text>
<text> Master, how did you know? </text>
<text> Master, it shouldn't take me long. </text>
<text> Master. </text>
<text> Am I fit to serve you, master, in all my ugliness? </text>
<text> Did I just hear my mum speaking? </text>
<text> Thank you very much. </text>
<text> Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful. </text>
<text> And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice. </text>
<text> Please, if I may dream, just once... </text>
<text> Do you feel the same way my mum did, m'lord? </text>
<text> Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks? </text>
<text> &lt;sob&gt; </text>
<text> M'lord, my dear lord... </text>
<text> I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service. </text>
<text> May the throne of Elden Lord be yours. </text>
<text> No, why on earth would you... </text>
<text> It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did. </text>
<text> But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance. </text>
<text> One day, I'll look every bit the servant. </text>
<text> Did I just hear my mum speaking? </text>
<text> Thank you very much. </text>
<text> Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful. </text>
<text> And now, my kind master let me hear her voice. </text>
<text> Please, if I may dream, just once... </text>
<text> Do you feel the same way my mum did, master? </text>
<text> Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks? </text>
<text> &lt;sob&gt; </text>
<text> Master, kind master... </text>
<text> I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service. </text>
<text> No, why on earth would you... </text>
<text> It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did. </text>
<text> But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance. </text>
<text> One day, I'll look every bit the servant. </text>
<text> S-surely, not? For me?! </text>
<text> Oh no, I can't. It would be wasted on the likes of me. </text>
<text> You should drink it yourself, master. </text>
<text> I would be far happier knowing you enjoyed it yourself. </text>
<text> S-surely, not? For me?! </text>
<text> Oh no, I can't. It would be wasted on the likes of me. </text>
<text> You should drink it yourself, m'lord. </text>
<text> I would be far happier knowing you enjoyed it yourself. </text>
<text> Master... </text>
<text> O-oh... </text>
<text> My most earnest thanks. </text>
<text> I don't deserve it, but I'll savour every last drop. </text>
<text> M'lord... </text>
<text> O-oh... </text>
<text> My most earnest thanks. </text>
<text> I don't deserve it, but I'll savour every last drop. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ow! </text>
<text> Why'd you go and do that? </text>
<text> It's because I'm ugly, isn't it? </text>
<text> Oh, now, you too, is it? </text>
<text> The story of my rotten life... </text>
<text> Ah...aaah! </text>
<text> No... </text>
<text> I never wanted this... </text>
<text> Mum... </text>
<text> I've... I've let you down... </text>
<text> Ow! </text>
<text> M-master? </text>
<text> Is something wrong? </text>
<text> It's me! Boc, the seamster! </text>
<text> Master, what's happened... </text>
<text> Did I do something wrong? </text>
<text> Or is it just...because I'm ugly? </text>
<text> Oh, my... </text>
<text> Master, is that the truth, your heart of hearts? My, oh my... </text>
<text> Ah...aaah! </text>
<text> Oh, master, what have I done... </text>
<text> Master! Master! </text>
<text> Master... </text>
<text> I've failed you...please, forgive me. </text>
<text> Ow! </text>
<text> M-m'lord? </text>
<text> Is something wrong? </text>
<text> It's me! Boc, the seamster! </text>
<text> M'lord, what's happened... </text>
<text> Did I do something wrong? </text>
<text> Or is it just...because I'm ugly? </text>
<text> Oh, my... </text>
<text> M'lord, is that the truth, your heart of hearts? My, oh my... </text>
<text> Ah...aaah! </text>
<text> M'lord, what have I done... </text>
<text> M'lord! M'lord! </text>
<text> M'lord... </text>
<text> I've failed you...please, forgive me. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Well, look at you. We don't receive many visitors. </text>
<text> I presume you are a Tarnished. What brings you here? </text>
<text> Oh, pardon me. It's hardly my place to ask, is it. </text>
<text> I am Iji. A blacksmith who once served the Carian royals… </text>
<text> An old codger who refuses to retire his rusty hammer. </text>
<text> So, here I am, still quietly plying my trade, on this spot. </text>
<text> Perhaps you'd like a display? These bones are old, but still able. </text>
<text> Well, it's kind of you to speak to me again. </text>
<text> Then I presume these old bones served their purpose, more or less? </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished. Here to put my old bones to work again? </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished. A word of warning, if you please. </text>
<text> This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point. </text>
<text> When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract. </text>
<text> After leveling it, they carried on to the manor. </text>
<text> The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught... </text>
<text> By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day. </text>
<text> That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor. </text>
<text> Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo. </text>
<text> Oh, watch out, there. </text>
<text> When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else. </text>
<text> If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm. </text>
<text> I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, Tarnished. </text>
<text> You don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I work. </text>
<text> Something else for you? </text>
<text> I've explained the peril. </text>
<text> Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor. </text>
<text> Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap. </text>
<text> Blaidd actually did that, did he? </text>
<text> Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he. </text>
<text> Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you. </text>
<text> At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd, </text>
<text> I've a few more things that might suit you. </text>
<text> I've something else that might suit you. </text>
<text> Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. </text>
<text> Again, I am Iji. </text>
<text> The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. </text>
<text> I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd. </text>
<text> I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success. </text>
<text> The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. </text>
<text> I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd. </text>
<text> I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success. </text>
<text> Oh, then you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. </text>
<text> The pleasure is mine. I am Iji. </text>
<text> I take it you've heard of the Eternal City of Nokstella? </text>
<text> Well, it has a twin, known as Nokron. The other Eternal City. </text>
<text> After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron. </text>
<text> By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above. </text>
<text> Only, we've failed to find a path leading to the city. </text>
<text> Blaidd's made a good go of it, but I'm afraid this has him quite stumped. </text>
<text> To be honest, I'm not sure where to go from here... </text>
<text> Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother. </text>
<text> Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood. </text>
<text> They were always happy to have me tag along, as well. </text>
<text> When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean, </text>
<text> Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals, </text>
<text> but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together. </text>
<text> Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you? </text>
<text> The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you. </text>
<text> Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while. </text>
<text> Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family. </text>
<text> An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric. </text>
<text> No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival. </text>
<text> Oh, no, wait... </text>
<text> How did I not see it before! </text>
<text> I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight! </text>
<text> Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars. </text>
<text> As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line. </text>
<text> But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars. </text>
<text> Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory. </text>
<text> And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. </text>
<text> As would Lady Ranni's destiny. </text>
<text> Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron. </text>
<text> My apologies for the misleading words of warning. </text>
<text> I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate. </text>
<text> I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not. </text>
<text> Do forgive me, my fellow. </text>
<text> Let us give all that we can of ourselves. </text>
<text> Together, for Lady Ranni. </text>
<text> Let us give all that we can of ourselves. </text>
<text> Together, for Lady Ranni. </text>
<text> Let us give all that we can of ourselves. </text>
<text> Together, for Lady Ranni. </text>
<text> Well, my fellow. How may I serve you? </text>
<text> As war counsellor, or as blacksmith? </text>
<text> Greetings, my fellow. How can I help? </text>
<text> Something else for you? </text>
<text> Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds. </text>
<text> Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. </text>
<text> Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron. </text>
<text> Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything. </text>
<text> You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars. </text>
<text> The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all. </text>
<text> There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character. </text>
<text> Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened. </text>
<text> Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave. </text>
<text> And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. </text>
<text> Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you. </text>
<text> Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron. </text>
<text> Blaidd has been given an important task. </text>
<text> Apparently, a matter of great urgency. </text>
<text> You need not await Blaidd. </text>
<text> Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave. </text>
<text> And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. </text>
<text> So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean. </text>
<text> Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated... </text>
<text> Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled. </text>
<text> Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role. </text>
<text> Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made. </text>
<text> With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality... </text>
<text> Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed... </text>
<text> Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while. </text>
<text> Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family. </text>
<text> An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric. </text>
<text> It's funny how things happen. </text>
<text> Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate. </text>
<text> I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor... </text>
<text> I presume you've spoken with Blaidd? </text>
<text> Very well. There is something you should know. </text>
<text> The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery. </text>
<text> But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers, </text>
<text> the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse. </text>
<text> But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight. </text>
<text> It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake. </text>
<text> Unthinkable, how could Blaidd... </text>
<text> How did he break free from his cell? </text>
<text> No, more importantly... </text>
<text> Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her. </text>
<text> I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor... </text>
<text> I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd. </text>
<text> When I do, I only hope you'll accept my apology. </text>
<text> Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. </text>
<text> You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars. </text>
<text> A grand reward, justly procured by any measure. </text>
<text> Again, I am Iji. </text>
<text> The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. </text>
<text> I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni. </text>
<text> Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened. </text>
<text> Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave. </text>
<text> And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. </text>
<text> So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean. </text>
<text> Oh, so you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. </text>
<text> You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars. </text>
<text> A grand reward, justly procured by any measure. </text>
<text> The pleasure is mine. I am Iji. </text>
<text> The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. </text>
<text> I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni. </text>
<text> Oh, there you are. Good of you to drop by. </text>
<text> Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey. </text>
<text> Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it. </text>
<text> It would not have been possible without you. </text>
<text> As Lady Ranni's war counsellor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude. </text>
<text> You, and only you, were Lady Ranni's true champion. </text>
<text> My purpose is nearing its end. </text>
<text> I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember... </text>
<text> It has been a long and wondrous journey. </text>
<text> Now Lady Ranni is in your hands. </text>
<text> I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end. </text>
<text> Well, what's this? </text>
<text> Are you certain? This is a fine reserve. </text>
<text> Perhaps you knew that Old Iji appreciates a good drink. </text>
<text> I'll save it for a quiet moment, that I might truly savour it. </text>
<text> Lady Ranni has departed on her journey. </text>
<text> Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it. </text>
<text> Now Lady Ranni is in your hands. </text>
<text> I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> Enough of that, Tarnished. </text>
<text> There is no fight without a foe. </text>
<text> If that's the cloth you're cut from, </text>
<text> don't ever show your face again. </text>
<text> Not to me. And not to my liege. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Not to me. And not to my liege. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> How could I have missed this... </text>
<text> I have failed you... </text>
<text> Lady... Ranni... </text>
<text> Agh. </text>
<text> Cease this treachery at once. </text>
<text> Lady Ranni will be devastated. </text>
<text> This is a true shame. </text>
<text> Don't ever show your face again. </text>
<text> Not to me. And not to my liege. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Lady Ranni has seen enough. </text>
<text> Go as you must, Lady Ranni... </text>
<text> Along the path of darkness... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Hallo coz, what are you doing here? </text>
<text> Hallo coz, what are you doing here? </text>
<text> I didn't think anyone knew about this place, 'cept us jars. </text>
<text> Oh! Are you going to be the new Potentate? </text>
<text> Gosh, truly? That's wonderful news! </text>
<text> It's not easy being Potentate, though. </text>
<text> I know, show me your hands. </text>
<text> It's just a little test, coz, to see if you've got the right stuff. </text>
<text> It's just a little test, coz, to see if you've got the right stuff. </text>
<text> Hmm. </text>
<text> Your skin isn't so smooth, is it... </text>
<text> You need slick, slidey hands to be Potentate, you know. </text>
<text> I'm sorry coz, but I don't think you've got what it takes... </text>
<text> I'm sorry coz, but I don't think you've got what it takes... </text>
<text> What a shame... </text>

<text> I asked the villagers if you could pick some of them. </text>
<text> I asked the villagers if you could pick some of them. </text>
<text> I asked the villagers if you could pick some of them. </text>
<text> And they said you'd be very welcome! </text>
<text> The flowers we have now are nice, but it's a bit boring having the same ones all the time. </text>
<text> I think everyone would be glad of a change, actually... </text>
<text> You know the huge vase, at the centre of our village? </text>
<text> If you plant lovely flower seeds inside the big vase, coz... </text>

<text> Those flowers will bloom all through the whole village! </text>

<text> Oh first though, if you have some nice flower seeds, </text>
<text> can you put them in the big vase in the middle of the village? </text>

<text> You put seeds in the big vase, didn't you? </text>
<text> Such pretty flowers are blooming! Everyone's so happy. </text>
<text> I've never seen anything like it! I'd love to see more flowers from the outside, someday. Loads more! </text>
<text> Oh, hallo again, coz. </text>
<text> Oh, hallo again, coz. </text>
<text> You put seeds in the big vase, didn't you? </text>
<text> But...I don't really like those flowers. </text>
<text> I'm sorry coz, I know you brought the seeds from all that way away... </text>
<text> I'm sorry coz, I know you brought the seeds from all that way away... </text>
<text> But I'm a jar, and you're not. I s'pose we just see things differently. </text>
<text> But I'm a jar, and you're not. I s'pose we just see things differently. </text>
<text> Ah, hallo again. </text>
<text> Say, coz. Have you met Uncle Alexander? </text>
<text> Say, coz. Have you met Uncle Alexander? </text>
<text> He used to live here with us, but then he left, to be a champion. </text>
<text> I asked to go with him, but he said "The path of champions must be trod alone". </text>
<text> So heroic, right? I miss him though. </text>
<text> If you see him, you should ask him to teach you how to fight, coz. </text>
<text> If you see him, you should ask him to teach you how to fight, coz. </text>
<text> He's big and tough and strong! </text>
<text> Uncle Alexander said he won't be back again. </text>
<text> My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country. </text>
<text> I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it. </text>
<text> So...please don't tell anyone, coz, but... </text>
<text> So...please don't tell anyone, coz, but... </text>
<text> I'm actually a warrior jar as well! One day, I'll be just like Uncle Alexander. </text>
<text> And I'll have to leave the village to become a champion. </text>
<text> Uncle Alexander won't come back here again. </text>
<text> My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country. </text>
<text> I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it. </text>
<text> Ah, hallo again. </text>
<text> Do you know what a poacher is, coz? </text>
<text> Do you know what a poacher is, coz? </text>
<text> They hunt us, smash us, and then take us away. </text>
<text> This village is kept secret, so I think we're safe here. </text>
<text> But you should be careful if you ever meet one of them, coz. </text>
<text> But you should be careful if you ever meet one of them, coz. </text>
<text> I hope uncle Alexander beats them all up, first... </text>
<text> Those awful poachers. I hope uncle Alexander beats them all up. </text>
<text> Oh, hallo again, coz. </text>
<text> Oh, hallo again, coz. </text>
<text> Have you heard? A new Potentate's come to the village! </text>
<text> I think he said his name was Diallos. </text>
<text> He seems a little down in the dumps, but his hands! As smooth as silk! </text>
<text> I don't know, I'm a little disappointed actually. </text>
<text> Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour... </text>
<text> He says he isn't a warrior. </text>
<text> And since he's a coward, he won't be fighting anymore. </text>
<text> His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us. </text>
<text> But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you. </text>
<text> But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you. </text>
<text> Diallos' smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us... </text>
<text> But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you. </text>

<text> But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you. </text>
<text> O-oh! Coz! </text>
<text> O-oh! Coz! </text>
<text> I'm glad you came. </text>
<text> But we're fine now. Diallos fought the poacher. </text>
<text> Though quite a lot of us got broken... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I won't cry though... I'm a warrior jar. A warrior. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood. </text>
<text> That's the kind of warrior I want to be one day, coz. </text>
<text> That's the kind of warrior I want to be one day, coz. </text>
<text> Even if I'm scared, I'll still fight to protect everyone. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood. </text>
<text> That's the kind of warrior I'm going to be. </text>
<text> One who protects everybody. </text>
<text> Thanks for coming back, coz. </text>
<text> Thanks for coming back, coz. </text>
<text> I've been thinking. It's time for me to set out on a journey. </text>
<text> As a warrior jar, upon the path of champions. </text>
<text> Wow, coz, are these... </text>
<text> Wow, coz, are these... </text>
<text> Insides? </text>
<text> From Uncle Alexander? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Thank you, coz. </text>
<text> Thank you, coz. </text>
<text> I'm a warrior jar, so I need to be strong. </text>
<text> I can really have them, right? </text>
<text> I understand. I'll get strong. </text>
<text> Strong enough I deserve to have Uncle's insides. </text>
<text> I'm about to go on a journey. </text>
<text> As a warrior jar, in search of glory. </text>
<text> Oh, hallo again, coz. </text>
<text> Oh, hallo again, coz. </text>
<text> Oh, hallo again, coz. </text>
<text> No, I haven't changed my mind. </text>
<text> I'll begin my journey once I'm ready to go. </text>
<text> As a warrior jar, in search of glory. </text>
<text> I'll begin my journey once I'm ready to go. </text>
<text> As a warrior jar, in search of glory. </text>
<text> I don't think I'll see you again, when I set out. </text>
<text> Warriors are supposed to work alone. </text>
<text> Goodbye, coz. </text>
<text> Goodbye, coz. </text>
<text> And thanks for everything. </text>
<text> I'll never forget you, coz. </text>

<text> Coz... </text>
<text> Coz... </text>
<text> Coz... </text>
<text> Tell me a story... About the big, wide world... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Uncle Alexander, look! </text>
<text> It's me! I'm a warrior jar too! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Stop, no... </text>
<text> Please, no, don't break us... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> They're wonderful, Diallos. </text>
<text> So smooth, and silky... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow... </text>
<text> ...is told in blood... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Oh? </text>
<text> What's the matter, coz? </text>
<text> What's the matter, coz? </text>
<text> What's the matter, coz? </text>
<text> Don't be such a nasty brute. </text>
<text> Is this who you are, coz? </text>
<text> Is this who you are, coz? </text>
<text> Is this who you are, coz? </text>
<text> You've cracked my heart. </text>
<text> Please, don't crack the others... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> You were a poacher, all along. </text>
<text> You were a poacher, all along. </text>
<text> You were a poacher, all along. </text>
<text> You've cracked my heart. </text>
<text> Please, don't crack the others... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> So, you were a poacher, too. </text>
<text> So, you were a poacher, too. </text>
<text> So, you were a poacher, too. </text>
<text> But the tale of house Hoslow is told in blood. </text>
<text> I'll find you, one day, coz... </text>
<text> I'll find you, one day, coz... </text>
<text> I'll find you, one day, coz... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Sister... Where did you go? </text>
<text> You promised me. When we turned 14, we'd go to see the stars... </text>
<text> I've been waiting ever so long. Forever and ever, it seems. </text>
<text> Ahh, dear sister, you're finally here. </text>
<text> No time to waste. Let's see the stars. </text>
<text> Foul Tarnished, what do you want? </text>
<text> I told the all-hearing brute. </text>
<text> That I possess no such medallion. </text>
<text> Or have you come to take more from me? </text>
<text> Was my other half not enough? </text>
<text> I told the bastard in the bone armour. </text>
<text> I told the all-hearing brute already. </text>
<text> That I possess no such medallion. </text>
<text> Or have you come to take more from me? </text>
<text> Was my other half not enough? </text>
<text> I told the bastard in bone armour already. </text>
<text> Oh...do you speak true? </text>
<text> So old Albus entrusted his medallion to you. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Then I've no choice. But to trust that this was his dying will. </text>
<text> Let's try again. I'm Latenna. An Albinauric, the same as Old Albus. </text>
<text> My apologies for my coarse words earlier. </text>
<text> I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like that all-hearing brute. </text>
<text> I hope that you will forgive me. </text>
<text> I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like the bastard before. </text>
<text> Mm, the medallion is better off in your hands, anyway. </text>
<text> Would you consider doing me a great service? </text>
<text> I must go back. </text>
<text> There is something that I must do, even if I must say farewell to my wolf, Lobo. </text>
<text> Will you show me the way? To the land of Miquella's Haligtree. </text>
<text> If you accept, I would gladly apprise you. </text>
<text> Of the whereabouts of the medallion's other half. </text>
<text> Thank you kindly. </text>
<text> They say the other half of the medallion is beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> Then I suppose it's time. </text>
<text> Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half. </text>
<text> I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain. </text>
<text> Forgive me, Lobo. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Call upon me when needed. </text>
<text> And I will fight at your side. </text>
<text> Well... </text>
<text> I understand. You must have your own duty to fulfil. </text>
<text> But please, allow me to say my piece. </text>
<text> Even if you cannot take me, old Albus wished I relay to you the following: </text>
<text> The other half of the medallion can be found beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold. </text>
<text> If you seek the other half of the medallion, they say it's beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold. </text>
<text> My thanks... </text>
<text> You'll lead me then, to the land of Miquella's Haligtree. </text>
<text> Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half. </text>
<text> I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain. </text>
<text> Forgive me, Lobo. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna. </text>
<text> We're almost there. Castle Sol lies just off to the north, </text>
<text> where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree. </text>
<text> Castle Sol lies just off to the north, </text>
<text> where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree. </text>
<text> Oh young yet towering sister of ours. </text>
<text> Let the birthing droplet in. </text>
<text> And create life. For us. For all the Albinaurics. </text>
<text> Thank you. </text>
<text> I've finally fulfilled my purpose. </text>
<text> Our young yet towering sister will give us hope. </text>
<text> Now that nothing is left unfinished, </text>
<text> I will join you in battle to the bitter end. </text>
<text> And when the fighting is done, </text>
<text> then you may lay me to rest. Beside Lobo, my dear wolf. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna. </text>
<text> We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree, where Lobo and I began our travels. </text>
<text> It's entirely thanks to you that I'm so close to home. </text>
<text> These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north. </text>
<text> And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina, </text>
<text> lies the place to which I must return. </text>
<text> We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree. </text>

<text> And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina, </text>

<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> Stop, now. </text>
<text> And I'll consider that a simple mishap. </text>
<text> Are all you Tarnished the same? </text>
<text> Was taking my other half not enough for you? </text>
<text> There is no meaning in a fight, lest it serve a greater duty. </text>
<text> Ohh...Phillia </text>
<text> Take...the birthing...droplet... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished, welcome to the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. </text>
<text> Rya spoke well of you. </text>
<text> A warrior of promise, I believe she said. </text>
<text> Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment. </text>
<text> Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor, and resist the tide? </text>
<text> Why accept the burden of their grace, or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers? </text>
<text> Rise with us, against the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Interesting. Your decision is most welcome. </text>
<text> Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. </text>
<text> The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. </text>
<text> But be sure to earn your keep. </text>
<text> Well. That is unfortunate. </text>
<text> Rya will be disappointed, but I won't twist your arm. </text>
<text> Now, time for you to leave, I should think. </text>
<text> Let this intersection of our paths be the last. </text>
<text> Aren't you precocious. </text>
<text> We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation. </text>
<text> Fascinating. And not unlike another guest we had long ago… </text>
<text> So, Tarnished, have you ever harboured doubts? </text>
<text> About the burden of grace, and the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers? </text>
<text> If you have, why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us? </text>
<text> Rise with us, against the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Your decision is most welcome. </text>
<text> Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. </text>
<text> The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. </text>
<text> I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you. </text>
<text> Well. That is unfortunate. </text>
<text> Now, time for you to leave, I should think. </text>
<text> Let this intersection of our paths be the last. </text>
<text> Did you read the letter left for you? </text>
<text> That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact. </text>
<text> You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck. </text>
<text> If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it. </text>
<text> But you must leave this house at once. </text>
<text> This is a war against the Erdtree. </text>
<text> We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands. </text>
<text> What's this? </text>
<text> Have you reconsidered the prospect? </text>
<text> Of rising with us, against the Erdtree? </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Your decision is most welcome. </text>
<text> Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. </text>
<text> The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. </text>
<text> You've completed your task. </text>
<text> I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> This is your reward, as promised. </text>
<text> Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion. </text>
<text> The way is tainted, but for this very reason, </text>
<text> it is the true path to valour. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> I see you've performed another task for us. </text>
<text> Here is your usual reward. Please, take it. </text>
<text> Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you. </text>
<text> Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard. </text>
<text> The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace. </text>
<text> But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task. </text>
<text> The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs. </text>
<text> Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering. </text>
<text> Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us. </text>
<text> If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so, </text>
<text> then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy. </text>
<text> We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done. </text>
<text> If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you. </text>
<text> The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle. </text>
<text> It cannot come a day too soon! </text>
<text> The letter describes the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact. </text>
<text> You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck. </text>
<text> If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you. </text>
<text> It cannot come a day too soon! </text>
<text> She said that, to you? </text>
<text> I should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough. </text>
<text> Well. Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you. </text>
<text> That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage. </text>
<text> Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself. </text>
<text> What matters one's lineage in such a crisis? </text>
<text> No, I haven't seen Zorayas anywhere. </text>
<text> And she has no scouting duties now. </text>
<text> Has she gone off in search of answers? </text>
<text> Why won't she just listen... </text>
<text> May I ask your aid? </text>
<text> Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother. </text>
<text> If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress, </text>
<text> have her drink this potion. </text>
<text> To purge that which would cause her pain. </text>
<text> Yes, I know. </text>
<text> My wish is a grave disrespect to her. </text>
<text> No different than the Erdtree's imposition. </text>
<text> But I've no choice... It must be done. </text>
<text> Thank you, for allowing me this. </text>
<text> I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail. </text>
<text> Our Lord must have known this all along. </text>
<text> My meekness is all too clear... </text>
<text> Really, she is dead, then... </text>
<text> My gratitude for your forthrightness. </text>
<text> If you would...allow me some time alone. </text>
<text> Please, allow me some time alone. </text>
<text> I see that you've stayed the path of champions. </text>
<text> This is your usual reward. Please, take it. </text>
<text> Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord? </text>
<text> Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions. </text>
<text> Yes, as it should be. </text>
<text> Now, close your eyes for a moment. </text>
<text> I will transport you to the Lord's chamber. </text>
<text> Farewell, then. </text>
<text> May your visit be fruitful. </text>
<text> I see... Well, I cannot make you take the leap. </text>
<text> But do know this. </text>
<text> To follow the path of valour, an audience with our Lord is essential. </text>
<text> In order to defy this debasement, and rise up against the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Like a true recusant of the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Won't you consider having an audience with our Lord? </text>
<text> Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions. </text>
<text> You... </text>
<text> It's true then. You've defeated our Lord. </text>
<text> No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that. </text>
<text> Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger. </text>
<text> Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part. </text>
<text> I will leave the Volcano Manor before long. </text>
<text> I suggest you do the same. </text>
<text> Here is my thanks. For allowing our Lord to be revived, even stronger than before. </text>
<text> I will miss these encounters. </text>
<text> The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more. </text>
<text> I always was an admirer. </text>
<text> Oh, you... </text>
<text> Allow me some time. </text>
<text> Our Lord's carcass is vast, and not easily consumed. </text>
<text> Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me, </text>
<text> I wish to be your serpent; your family. </text>
<text> One day, let us devour the gods together. </text>
<text> Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me, </text>
<text> I wish to be your serpent; your family. </text>
<text> One day, let us devour the gods together. </text>
<text> Now, time for you to leave, I should think. </text>
<text> Let this intersection of our paths be the last. </text>
<text> The drawing room is through the hall. </text>
<text> Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable. </text>
<text> What's this? </text>
<text> Have you reconsidered the prospect? </text>
<text> Of rising with us, against the Erdtree? </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Your decision is most welcome. </text>
<text> Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. </text>
<text> The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. </text>
<text> Now, time for you to leave, I should think. </text>
<text> Let this intersection of our paths be the last. </text>
<text> The drawing room is through the hall. </text>
<text> Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable. </text>
<text> Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> I am pleased to have you on our side. </text>
<text> Did you see her? </text>
<text> The girl, Rya…with her true face. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Well, if she confided in you the name Zorayas, </text>
<text> then perhaps it is not my place to speak. </text>
<text> But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you. </text>
<text> Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas. </text>
<text> Her true visage belies the purity of her heart. </text>
<text> …Honestly, I hardly deserve the sweet child. </text>
<text> Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas. </text>
<text> Her true visage belies the purity of her heart. </text>
<text> Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you. </text>
<text> That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage. </text>
<text> My wish is a grave disrespect to her. </text>
<text> But I've no choice... It must be done. </text>
<text> Sweet Zorayas, have I earned your scorn? </text>
<text> This is farewell. </text>
<text> Perhaps we will meet again, along the path. </text>
<text> What is it? </text>
<text> I have no need of that. </text>
<text> I must continue devouring my beloved lord... </text>
<text> Oh, you... </text>
<text> Allow me some time. </text>
<text> Our lord's carcass is not easily consumed. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> Ahh, my lord... </text>
<text> Rykard... </text>
<text> Oh, Rykard… </text>
<text> Let me be your serpent… </text>
<text> Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we? </text>
<text> Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm? </text>
<text> Of course you have. No shame in it. </text>
<text> But I'm afraid you're plumb out of luck. </text>
<text> You are maidenless. A bit player, fully divorced from the strength of runes. </text>
<text> Feel free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere. </text>
<text> Oh, can't seem to wrap your head around your predicament? </text>
<text> It's no surprise. You poor have-nots are a stubborn lot. </text>
<text> Fine, then. </text>
<text> If you must have a go at it, maidenless as you are, you'll require an education. </text>
<text> On the ways of the learned Tarnished. </text>
<text> Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished. </text>
<text> You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times. </text>
<text> That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel. </text>
<text> It's nothing short of a miracle. That the guidance of grace can lead you, </text>
<text> maidenless as you are, to the perfect place to die in obscurity. </text>
<text> What's the matter? </text>
<text> Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such? </text>
<text> Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace. </text>
<text> To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff. </text>
<text> And if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle, </text>
<text> you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold… </text>
<text> Guidance will show the way, most certainly. </text>
<text> To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff. </text>
<text> The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted. </text>
<text> Although I'm afraid you'll never make it that far, hmm. </text>
<text> Rest assured, I sympathise, deeply. There's no worse fate than to be maidenless. </text>
<text> Oh, but if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle, </text>
<text> you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold… </text>
<text> Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we? </text>
<text> Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm? </text>
<text> Of course you have. No shame in it. </text>
<text> Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless. </text>
<text> Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold... </text>
<text> You are fated, it seems, to die in obscurity. </text>
<text> Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless. </text>
<text> Me. Varré. Take care to listen. </text>
<text> Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished. </text>
<text> You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times. </text>
<text> That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel. </text>
<text> Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers. </text>
<text> It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow. </text>
<text> Even if it leads you to your grave. </text>
<text> Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly. </text>
<text> To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff. </text>
<text> The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted. </text>
<text> It's time you set off, I should think. </text>
<text> To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you. </text>
<text> If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are. </text>
<text> Ohh, well done, well done indeed. </text>
<text> You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil. </text>
<text> And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold… My sincerest congratulations. </text>
<text> But, how did you find the Roundtable? </text>
<text> Oh, you don't have to say it. </text>
<text> Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens. </text>
<text> I fear you've been terribly disappointed. </text>
<text> I don't blame you. But still, the Roundtable has its perks. </text>
<text> Why not earn a seat? Fly straight and true, so to speak. </text>
<text> Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed. </text>
<text> To join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune, and request audience... </text>
<text> ...with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. </text>
<text> They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished. </text>
<text> Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself. </text>
<text> Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune. </text>
<text> Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune. </text>
<text> Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft... </text>
<text> So. Prepare for the worst. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well. </text>
<text> Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided. </text>
<text> But then again, if you should realise the error of your ways, </text>
<text> I'm always willing to hear you out. </text>
<text> Oh, have you decided to have a go after all? At joining the Roundtable proper? </text>
<text> What's the matter? </text>
<text> Aren't you supposed to be earning your place at the Roundtable Hold? </text>
<text> Then you must face Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, </text>
<text> for without a Great Rune, you will not be granted audience. </text>
<text> With the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. </text>
<text> Ohh, well done, well done indeed. </text>
<text> You bested Godrick the Grafted, and claimed a Great Rune. </text>
<text> You felled a demigod, and claimed a Great Rune. </text>
<text> My congratulations. </text>
<text> Now, visit the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. </text>
<text> Go to the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. </text>
<text> Ah, there you are. </text>
<text> You claimed a Great Rune, and had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> You've had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> What was your impression? </text>
<text> Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well. </text>
<text> My doubts had been piling up, you see. </text>
<text> ...The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted. </text>
<text> Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions. </text>
<text> I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed. </text>
<text> Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind. </text>
<text> That's the part that irks the most. </text>
<text> Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise. </text>
<text> A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers. </text>
<text> Give it a try, won't you? </text>
<text> And if it please you, may we meet again. </text>
<text> I've high hopes for you. My lambkin. </text>
<text> You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be. </text>
<text> You may go, then. My work here is done. </text>
<text> May the wisdom of the Two Fingers guide you. </text>
<text> Oh? Is something wrong? </text>
<text> Be sure to try that finger I gave you. </text>
<text> There's no reason to dither. </text>
<text> The Tarnished were spurned by grace, forsaken by the Two Fingers. And now they ask you to mend their crumbling world? </text>
<text> Hah, your loyalties are misplaced with them. </text>
<text> Be sure to try that finger I gave you. </text>
<text> I'm quite certain that you'll take to it. </text>
<text> Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here. </text>
<text> I'm glad that you're enjoying my gift. </text>
<text> Mmm, I knew it from the very start. </text>
<text> You have a taste for noble blood. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I wish to anoint you a proper inductee. </text>
<text> A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty. </text>
<text> Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love. </text>
<text> So, what do you say, my lambkin? </text>
<text> Mm, yes, who would have it any other way? </text>
<text> Now, take this. </text>
<text> For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood. </text>
<text> Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers. </text>
<text> But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do. </text>
<text> Oh my, perhaps you misheard me. </text>
<text> Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two. </text>
<text> For your ears to clear out. </text>
<text> Oh, it's you. </text>
<text> Could you tell me once more? Your honest reply. </text>
<text> Ahh, my lambkin. </text>
<text> You've completed your final trial. </text>
<text> And with this, you are a formal inductee. </text>
<text> A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty. </text>
<text> Now, give me your finger. </text>
<text> This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you. </text>
<text> Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something. </text>
<text> Never forget that feeling of agony. </text>
<text> For it is what binds you, to Luminary Mohg. To all of us. </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> You have the sweetest scream. My lambkin. </text>
<text> Oh, another thing. You should have this. </text>
<text> A medal granted by the new Mohgwyn dynasty. </text>
<text> With the power to grant audience with Luminary Mohg. </text>
<text> I've gone out of my way to provide one to you. </text>
<text> But you mustn't use it just yet. </text>
<text> The meeting must wait until the Mohgwyn dynasty commences. </text>
<text> Luminary Mohg yet slumbers beside the Divinity. </text>
<text> We must endure a little longer. </text>
<text> Ahh, it is trying, but we must be patient. </text>
<text> One day, you will be elevated, deservedly, basking in love. </text>
<text> Right, my lambkin? </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> The cloth is your final trial. Soak it with the blood of a maiden. </text>
<text> The blood of anyone's maiden will do. You are maidenless, after all. </text>
<text> What business does a maidenless wretch like you have here? </text>
<text> Did you come seeking violence, upon learning my esteemed position under Luminary Mohg? </text>
<text> I'll take pleasure in ensuring you regret this. </text>
<text> Before you die in obscurity. </text>
<text> You seek violence, heedless of my warning, though you have been raised to a knight of the dynasty? </text>
<text> I am pained, to the very depths of my being. </text>
<text> I'll ensure you regret this, my lambkin. </text>
<text> Enjoy your miserable death. </text>
<text> How dare you trouble Luminary Mohg's passions. </text>
<text> You vulgar churl. </text>
<text> I made a grave error. </text>
<text> Why must I be... </text>
<text> Disgraced by this lowborn... </text>
<text> O...Luminary...Mohg... </text>
<text> Please grant...the strength...you promised... </text>
<text> I have given...everything... </text>
<text> Please...my lord... </text>
<text> Please, answer me...Luminary...Mohg. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> A-ahh... </text>
<text> Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love! </text>
<text> &lt;groan&gt; </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Oh? </text>
<text> Do you even comprehend? </text>
<text> The gravity of this choice. </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> If you mistake kindness for frailty of heart, </text>
<text> then perhaps a more physical lesson is in order! </text>
<text> You disappoint me. </text>
<text> Perhaps noble blood is too rich for the maidenless. </text>
<text> Well, no sense in sparing your life now. </text>
<text> You were a maidenless upstart to begin with. </text>
<text> You will die nameless, without ceremony. </text>
<text> Oh dear, a pity it's come to this, my lambkin. </text>
<text> How does it feel to die a failure? </text>
<text> Materials of quality are so hard to find, these days... </text>
<text> You maidenless runt... </text>
<text> Who do you think I am? </text>
<text> &lt;groan&gt; </text>
<text> Luminary Mohg... </text>
<text> Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love! </text>
<text> &lt;groan&gt; </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> You there. </text>
<text> Come over here, would you? </text>
<text> You're Tarnished, aren't you? </text>
<text> I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle. </text>
<text> It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands. </text>
<text> Try the opening right here. </text>
<text> The guards don't know about it. </text>
<text> You'll breach the castle undetected. </text>
<text> Yes, that's the spirit. </text>
<text> ...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like. </text>
<text> I pray for your success. </text>
<text> Fair enough, you certainly don't have to trust me. </text>
<text> Well, If you must go through the gates, I'll signal them to open. </text>
<text> But of course, I'd advise against it. </text>
<text> Use that opening to breach the castle. </text>
<text> The guards haven't a clue about it. </text>
<text> You'll slip right inside undetected. </text>
<text> Of course. I understand. </text>
<text> When you approach the gates, I'll signal them to open. </text>
<text> It's only your neck on the line, after all. </text>
<text> The gates! Open the gates! </text>
<text> ...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like. </text>
<text> I pray for your success. </text>
<text> The gates are open. Do as you like. </text>
<text> It's only your neck on the line, after all. </text>
<text> Oh, oh, you... </text>
<text> Oh, great, I'm glad you're here. </text>
<text> Just a small reward, I was saving it for you. </text>
<text> Please, it's all yours. </text>
<text> Good, now let's be on our way, shall we? </text>
<text> Wouldn't want the guards to spot you. </text>
<text> Hop along, will you? </text>
<text> What'll happen if the guards catch you strutting about? </text>
<text> Rubbish... </text>
<text> Another one...another one all skin and bones. </text>
<text> ...Worse than a petty squire... </text>
<text> ...Ahh, not a muscle on this one either... </text>
<text> Oh, you... </text>
<text> For god's sake, don't scare me like that! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> What, oh, just clearing out some corpses. </text>
<text> Can't just leave them about, you know, they'll start to pong, eh. </text>
<text> Oh, hello. No, don't you mind me for a minute. </text>
<text> It's my job to keep the grounds clean. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Oh, hello... Glad to see you safe. </text>
<text> I've come into some fine goods. </text>
<text> Only, it turns out I can't use a one of them. </text>
<text> Perhaps you'd like to take them off my hands? </text>
<text> Oh, hello, anything you'd care to purchase? </text>
<text> Fare thee well. </text>
<text> I pray for your success. </text>
<text> What a pathetic excuse for a Lord you were. Craven to the bone. </text>
<text> Pushing me about like that. And after all that grafting? Where did that get you? </text>
<text> Look down, on me, would you? </text>
<text> Godrick? You filthy slug. </text>
<text> Feel it! Feel it! Feel my bloody wrath! </text>
<text> Oh...hello there. </text>
<text> This weasel was... Godrick was always looking down on me. </text>
<text> He got what he bloody deserved, thanks to you. </text>
<text> I tell you though, what goes around comes around. </text>
<text> He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and met the ugliest of ends, eh. </text>
<text> He he he he he... </text>
<text> Now, I suppose I'm free. </text>
<text> I can do whatever takes my fancy... </text>
<text> Can't I, mate? </text>
<text> You giving that to me? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Well, I suppose I did save your life, in a way. </text>
<text> I'll gladly take it off your hands. Be rude not to, eh! </text>
<text> Mmm, you Tarnished are alright by me. </text>
<text> The sweet ones like you, anyway. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ah, you, is it? </text>
<text> Haven't seen your mug in quite some time. </text>
<text> As you can see, I'm the new Lady's attendant. </text>
<text> Freedom? Wasn't worth squat. </text>
<text> B-besides, I like it 'round 'ere... </text>
<text> Lady Nepheli's still fair of heart and countenance... </text>
<text> Still, I have the Lady's trust. </text>
<text> ...So I can loot all the corpses I like. </text>
<text> I'll let you take a look at the goods, if you fancy. </text>
<text> Ah, back again, are we? Curious one, you are. </text>
<text> Well then, what are you after? </text>
<text> Ouch! </text>
<text> Oi, what're you doing? </text>
<text> Stop that! </text>
<text> Blast, what's it to you! </text>
<text> Step back, you wretched Tarnished! </text>
<text> Finally given up the ghost, eh... </text>
<text> Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you... </text>
<text> Hah! Do you feel it? </text>
<text> Do you feel my bloody wrath? </text>
<text> Damn it all. Why is it always me... </text>
<text> What did I do to deserve... </text>
<text> But...I'm free... </text>
<text> I can do...what I like... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Good Lord! Good God of Vengeance! </text>
<text> Till grudges soak the lands! </text>
<text> Oh... </text>
<text> I see, you're Tarnished. </text>
<text> I am Guilbert. A Redeemer of vengeance. In all its forms. </text>
<text> By the way... </text>
<text> Have you heard of the crucible knights? </text>
<text> There's one by the name of Ordovis, and I must find him. </text>
<text> He's an old hero of the Shattering, but there's a grudge out against him. </text>
<text> The Lands Between are brimming with those who cannot die. It makes for a cesspool of vengeance. </text>
<text> ...Gives me a shiver just thinking about it... </text>
<text> These fellows? </text>
<text> Who knows, just some lads who did someone wrong. </text>
<text> They got what was coming, nothing more. </text>
<text> If you're intent on revenge, pray to the God of Vengeance. </text>
<text> You'll have yourself a corpse in no time. </text>
<text> You're Tarnished. Then you're here to fight, aren't you? </text>
<text> For the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Well, there's something you ought to know. </text>
<text> There's an aberration of a blacksmith past the checkpoint that leads to Stormveil. </text>
<text> He doesn't seem to think much of anyone or anything, but oddly, he's willing to smith weapons for Tarnished. </text>
<text> He has a fine arm. Have him take a crack at your goods. </text>
<text> ...The question for me, of course, is whether he's in need of any vengeance... </text>
<text> In the Lands Between, everyone lives longer than they should. </text>
<text> They may go mad, but even so, they plead to the God of Vengeance. </text>
<text> That's why I'm here. To exact revenge for those who can't do it themselves. </text>
<text> Like someone did for me, when I...when I was but a tyke. </text>
<text> Oh, there you are... </text>
<text> It must have been a dream. Strange. </text>
<text> I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis of the Crucible. </text>
<text> It was a revenge so sweet, fit to serve the very God of Vengeance. </text>
<text> Heh... </text>
<text> Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer, as well... </text>
<text> I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis, the Crucible Knight. </text>
<text> Ah, you... </text>
<text> Did you defeat Ordovis of the Crucible? </text>
<text> I could sense it. The God of Vengeance surely smiled upon that battle. </text>
<text> Heh... </text>
<text> Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer too... </text>
<text> Did you defeat Ordovis, the Crucible Knight. </text>
<text> Alright, then. </text>
<text> I'm off to Stormveil Castle. </text>
<text> Lord Godrick has kept busy with his grafting... </text>
<text> Slicing off arms like harvesting ears of wheat. He's run up a mighty debt in blood. </text>
<text> A demigod, yes, he may be... </text>
<text> But no one escapes a Redeemer. </text>
<text> I was thinking... </text>
<text> Godrick must have an idea. </text>
<text> About the vengeance sought by General Radahn, to whom I swore my oath. </text>
<text> ...Yes, Godrick's corpse will know what to do... </text>
<text> Godrick must know. </text>
<text> That of all the grudges born of the Shattering, Malenia the Rotted is the object of the most profound. </text>
<text> Ahh, my head is throbbing, everything is bright red... </text>
<text> Master Radahn, is this how it feels to ferment with vengeance? </text>
<text> I can hardly keep from trembling... </text>
<text> Well, well, you've made yourself a target of vengeance. </text>
<text> Perhaps this, too, was meant to be. </text>
<text> Prepare to become an offering. </text>
<text> Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse. </text>
<text> Hello there, I don't believe we've met. </text>
<text> I'm afraid you've made yourself the object of somebody's ire. </text>
<text> As a Redeemer, I'm bound to exact revenge. </text>
<text> Prepare to become an offering. </text>
<text> Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse. </text>
<text> Whoah, what're you playing at? (OKテイク, v303902000_ALT_3)<br>What're you playing at? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> This is a little awkward. </text>
<text> There's no revenge to be had in this killing. </text>
<text> Not too sharp, are you? </text>
<text> If you want to die, ask someone else. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Let it be known. </text>
<text> Wherever vengeance must be had, a Redeemer there will be... </text>
<text> Oh, my Lord. Good God of Vengeance! </text>
<text> Till grudges soak the lands... </text>
<text> Don't you see now? </text>
<text> There is no escape from a Redeemer. </text>
<text> Death ought to be earned. </text>
<text> What am I to make of this? </text>
<text> Didn't I tell you before? </text>
<text> No one escapes a Redeemer. </text>
<text> Prepare to become an offering, once and for all. </text>
<text> Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse. </text>
<text> I see... You must be Ranni's new hireling. </text>
<text> I see... You must be Ranni's new girl. </text>
<text> Yes, yes, I've heard all about you. </text>
<text> I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts. </text>
<text> I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you, </text>
<text> but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady, </text>
<text> I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you. </text>
<text> I reside...in another tower, close by. </text>
<text> Come and pay me a visit... </text>
<text> Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni. </text>
<text> If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you. </text>
<text> But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady? </text>
<text> Well, well. You took me at my word. </text>
<text> Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze... </text>
<text> Hmm, I suppose you're here now. </text>
<text> Perhaps I'll give you something to do. </text>
<text> I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion. </text>
<text> Even you can do that much, can't you? </text>
<text> Good, good. </text>
<text> Now I shall hand over the potion in question. </text>
<text> Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it. </text>
<text> I expect glad tidings. And soon. </text>
<text> I see... </text>
<text> What a wretched bunch you Tarnished are. </text>
<text> Do you understand? I've given you a very fine chance. </text>
<text> If you complete this simple task, I will graciously permit you to learn from me. </text>
<text> Even you wish to serve our Lady well, do you not? </text>
<text> Turn those little cogs upstairs, and return with the correct answer. </text>
<text> Have you fumbled out the correct answer now? </text>
<text> Then you will undertake my task? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> You are peerless in your dullardry. </text>
<text> Fine. I can feel my wits evaporating in your mere presence. </text>
<text> Don't bother wasting your breath on me again. </text>
<text> I could have sworn I told you to trouble me no more... </text>
<text> Are you here to tender your sincere apology, and undertake my task? </text>
<text> Good, good. </text>
<text> As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology. </text>
<text> Now I shall hand over the potion in question. </text>
<text> Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it. </text>
<text> I expect glad tidings. And soon. </text>
<text> I've no time for idle chit chat. </text>
<text> The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion. </text>
<text> Are we understood? Then off you trot. </text>
<text> I have enough on my plate. </text>
<text> Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion? </text>
<text> Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought. </text>
<text> Well done. You are a slight more useful than I had thought. </text>
<text> Very well. Then you shall have your gift. </text>
<text> Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis. </text>
<text> I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but... </text>
<text> If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady. </text>
<text> You wish to begin right this moment? </text>
<text> Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it. </text>
<text> Begging for another lesson so soon? </text>
<text> There remains much to be done. Make it quick. </text>
<text> Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not. </text>
<text> Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break. </text>
<text> Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you? </text>
<text> The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not? </text>
<text> Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot. </text>
<text> Well...there's no helping it. </text>
<text> Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it. </text>
<text> There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave. </text>
<text> She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy. </text>
<text> I asked her to look into the matter some time ago. </text>
<text> I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her. </text>
<text> So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly? </text>
<text> Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it. </text>
<text> It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe. </text>
<text> I may have expected too much of her, to begin with. </text>
<text> You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please? </text>
<text> Your oafishness knows no bounds. </text>
<text> Fine and well. </text>
<text> You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion. </text>
<text> I believe that makes you my accomplice. </text>
<text> You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm? </text>
<text> Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed. </text>
<text> But perhaps I can make a very special exception. </text>
<text> Now, choose. </text>
<text> Ah, I knew you'd see things my way. </text>
<text> You knew you were already my accomplice, and as such... </text>
<text> You wanted one for yourself, hmm? A puppet, to cherish. </text>
<text> Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are. </text>
<text> Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are. </text>
<text> Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road. </text>
<text> To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire. </text>
<text> Now, choose. </text>
<text> Well, this is a surprise. </text>
<text> But aren't we forgetting something? </text>
<text> The tipple you fooled Nepheli into drinking, yes, my little draught. </text>
<text> You are already my accomplice. </text>
<text> Are you ready to change your mind, now? </text>
<text> It's no sin, pining for a puppet to cherish. </text>
<text> Now, hand it over, and don't make a fuss. </text>
<text> Nothing bad will happen. I'll even consider giving you a puppet of your own. </text>
<text> (huge sigh) </text>
<text> You truly are beyond salvation. </text>
<text> Fine. Leave this place, and never darken my doorstep again. </text>
<text> Ah, what a terrible pity. </text>
<text> This is the last time I'll see you, in your present state. </text>
<text> I thought I told you never to show your face again. </text>
<text> Have you decided to return what's mine, and proffer a sincere apology? </text>
<text> Good, good. </text>
<text> As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology. </text>
<text> And well, you finally realised, did you? </text>
<text> All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart. </text>
<text> Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are. </text>
<text> Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are. </text>
<text> Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road. </text>
<text> To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire. </text>
<text> Now, choose. </text>
<text> How's the puppet I gave you? </text>
<text> A thing of exquisite craft, is it not? </text>
<text> What's that? You want another puppet? </text>
<text> Quite the keen paramour, aren't we. </text>
<text> Well, aren't you a woman of many passions. </text>
<text> But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me. </text>
<text> I can hardly just give them away. </text>
<text> Oh dear, what's to be done? </text>
<text> Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards? </text>
<text> It's no mere booze, but a refined old drink of amber hue. </text>
<text> If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you. </text>
<text> The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few. </text>
<text> And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them. </text>
<text> Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road. </text>
<text> You're proving to be quite the puppeteer. </text>
<text> I've not had an apprentice for…a very long time indeed. </text>
<text> Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine? </text>
<text> It will produce the finest of puppets. </text>
<text> Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands. </text>
<text> A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound? </text>
<text> Ahh, I knew I had you pegged. </text>
<text> Heh. I knew I had you pegged. </text>
<text> You're just like me. </text>
<text> Then I'd like you to procure something. </text>
<text> A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber. </text>
<text> With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness. </text>
<text> And even a demigod would be slave to its charms... </text>
<text> Procure it for me. </text>
<text> The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber. </text>
<text> With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness. </text>
<text> And even a demigod would be slave to its charms... </text>
<text> Very good. </text>
<text> A wise choice, indeed. </text>
<text> You passed my little test with flying colours. </text>
<text> I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni. </text>
<text> Well done, I'm very proud of you. </text>
<text> Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady. </text>
<text> Ah ha. Might you be interested after all? </text>
<text> In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni? </text>
<text> Alright, enough of these games. </text>
<text> Your test is well and truly over. </text>
<text> Wag your tail for master all you like, but your loyalty is merely blind. </text>
<text> I fear your wretched provinciality is apt to burst. You're oozing at the seams. </text>
<text> Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it! </text>
<text> The blessed day is finally upon us... </text>
<text> Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting. </text>
<text> To think, this was once a demigod's very fate... </text>
<text> My oh my oh my... </text>
<text> Ah, are you still here? </text>
<text> Oh yes, I should give you your reward. </text>
<text> Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous. </text>
<text> Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin. </text>
<text> The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly... </text>
<text> Good, I've been waiting for you. </text>
<text> It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet. </text>
<text> Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it. </text>
<text> The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably. </text>
<text> Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona…she's a frail, gentle girl at heart. </text>
<text> Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's still just a feeble, pampered little girl when it comes down to it. </text>
<text> Which is why you're the only one for the job. </text>
<text> Now do it. Make Ranni drink my draught. </text>
<text> You...understand, don't you? </text>
<text> That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition. </text>
<text> And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted. </text>
<text> Just imagine...the pure elation... </text>
<text> Come now, don't make me wait. </text>
<text> I can barely contain myself as it is... </text>
<text> You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you. </text>
<text> The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly... </text>
<text> Hmm. Is that a scroll? </text>
<text> I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but... </text>
<text> You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it. </text>
<text> So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands. </text>
<text> That said, don't you dare get your hopes up. </text>
<text> More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect… </text>
<text> …upon the mediocrity of one's intellect. </text>
<text> Oh, perhaps you've already noticed. </text>
<text> The nightly wolf howling that's been disturbing the peace here. </text>
<text> If that bothersome mutt, Blaidd, is back in town, </text>
<text> then tell him to pack up and ship out. </text>
<text> I never liked the din of a dog's howl. </text>
<text> From a mongrel like him, it's simply agony. </text>
<text> Well, what have we here? </text>
<text> Are you proposing that I partake? </text>
<text> Do I appear such a gormless tomfool to you? </text>
<text> A slow-wit who'd divulge his secrets for a moment of bliss? </text>
<text> Well, let me give you some advice. </text>
<text> Scheming has its place, but consider the one you're scheming against. </text>
<text> You might find yourself on the wrong end of a proper beating one day. </text>
<text> O-oh! </text>
<text> Y-you! I, er, sorry, your worship... </text>
<text> Y-you! I, er, sorry, madam... </text>
<text> I-I apologise for any offence given. </text>
<text> I am Pidia. Servant to the Carian royal family. </text>
<text> I am charged with maintaining these g-ghastly dolls. </text>
<text> Ahh, your worship, allow me to be of use. </text>
<text> Ahh, kind madam, allow me to be of use. </text>
<text> Other than the puppets, there are some very fine things up here in this storeroom. </text>
<text> Why not pick something out, before you go? </text>
<text> But please, can you offer poor ill-starred Pidia... </text>
<text> A little something by way of compensation? </text>
<text> Ah, a fine day to your worship. </text>
<text> Ah, kind madam, a fine day to y-you. </text>
<text> Please, choose whatever you like. </text>
<text> Ah, I'm sorry your worship, but poor Pidia has given all he has. </text>
<text> Ah, I'm sorry kind madam, but poor Pidia has given all he has. </text>
<text> I can't be of further use to you. Please, forgive me. </text>
<text> Please, find it in your heart... Forgive me... </text>
<text> Argh! </text>
<text> Arrgh! </text>
<text> S-stop, please, stop! </text>
<text> Y-you're my puppets! I loved you with all I have! </text>
<text> How could you forget...such bliss? </text>
<text> Ouch! </text>
<text> That hurts! </text>
<text> Please, I beg you, cease this cruelty! </text>
<text> Eeek </text>
<text> Eeeeeeek! </text>
<text> Oh, that's very kind. </text>
<text> Poor Pidia could never accept such a precious brew. </text>
<text> Very sorry, really, if I... I've disappointed you, </text>
<text> If you will, please forget this matter entirely. </text>
<text> Agh! </text>
<text> Enough of that, now. </text>
<text> Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady? </text>
<text> You incorrigible lout. </text>
<text> Don't you dare waltz back here ever again. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Well, well, well? </text>
<text> Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings? </text>
<text> You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance! </text>
<text> Cough up your coin, all of it! </text>
<text> Wait, wait, please! </text>
<text> I surrender! White flag and all! </text>
<text> For Pete's sake! I concede! </text>
<text> No one likes a bull-headed brute, you know! </text>
<text> I yield, yield! You can't harm a yielding man! </text>
<text> Cripes, are you dense, boy? </text>
<text> Cripes, are you dense, sweetheart? </text>
<text> Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming. </text>
<text> We're about to make out like Bandits, boys! </text>
<text> Well, finally come around, have you? </text>
<text> I knew you would. You're a man of reason, through-and-through. </text>
<text> I knew you would. You're a lady of reason, through-and-through. </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> Ahhh... </text>
<text> Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me. </text>
<text> Now, how did I get that wrong? </text>
<text> I took you for a demi-human, or some such. </text>
<text> An innocent mistake, I assure you. </text>
<text> Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on? </text>
<text> A true man of reason. Just what I like about you. </text>
<text> A true lady of reason. Just what I like about you. </text>
<text> I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered. </text>
<text> Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say. </text>
<text> Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel. </text>
<text> In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes. </text>
<text> But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying. </text>
<text> Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop. </text>
<text> So, don't be a stranger, eh? </text>
<text> I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time. </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> Slow down, son... </text>
<text> Slow down, madame... </text>
<text> What's the matter? This simply isn't like you. </text>
<text> You've always known an innocent mistake when you see one. </text>
<text> Well, suit yourself. </text>
<text> I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered. </text>
<text> Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say. </text>
<text> Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits are paying for my gruel. </text>
<text> In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes. </text>
<text> But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying. </text>
<text> I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop. </text>
<text> So, don't be a stranger, eh? </text>
<text> I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time. </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend. </text>
<text> I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time. </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> Well, nice of you to drop in, finally. </text>
<text> It's all a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something. </text>
<text> And welcome to Patches' Emporium. </text>
<text> Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch. </text>
<text> Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium. </text>
<text> Cheers for that. </text>
<text> Stingy little beggar... </text>
<text> Try to find it in your heart next time, eh? </text>
<text> Yeah, I had those bandits make a clean break. </text>
<text> Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that. </text>
<text> I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying, </text>
<text> but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection. </text>
<text> They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army. </text>
<text> Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish. </text>
<text> ...It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all. </text>
<text> Hm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest? </text>
<text> Well, it's uh, nothing too special. </text>
<text> Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer... </text>
<text> But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin... </text>
<text> And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming... </text>
<text> Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take. </text>
<text> Forgot something on your shopping list? </text>
<text> No, no trouble to me. </text>
<text> By the way, friend... </text>
<text> You've really been there for me, through thick and thin. </text>
<text> And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you. </text>
<text> An extra-special thanks, for an extra-special customer. </text>
<text> What's wrong? I've made up my mind. </text>
<text> The treasure chest is yours, in word and deed. </text>
<text> Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold. </text>
<text> But a Patches Promise? Well, that's priceless! </text>
<text> Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive. </text>
<text> You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that. </text>
<text> Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm? </text>
<text> But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience. </text>
<text> At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe. </text>
<text> And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium! </text>
<text> Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive. </text>
<text> You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that. </text>
<text> Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests? </text>
<text> No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate. </text>
<text> At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe. </text>
<text> And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium! </text>
<text> Oh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave. </text>
<text> I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on. </text>
<text> No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop. </text>
<text> They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face. </text>
<text> Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh? </text>
<text> Oh, well! It's been a long while. </text>
<text> It's me. Patches the Untethered. </text>
<text> I'm still in business, if you can believe it. </text>
<text> Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch. </text>
<text> Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> You have yourself a discerning eye, I can tell. </text>
<text> That statuette will net you a small fortune, no doubt. </text>
<text> In fact, I'll bet any of those scruffy merchants would leap at the chance to buy it... </text>
<text> (laughs) </text>
<text> Oh, really? No interest in the statuette? </text>
<text> I was sure it would catch your eye. </text>
<text> Well, I can't force it on you, but... </text>
<text> Incomparable craftsmanship, you know. I'd hate to see it go to someone else... </text>
<text> By the way, have you met that girl Rya? </text>
<text> I spotted her somewhere along the highroad not long ago. </text>
<text> She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help. </text>
<text> Not that it's any of my business, but... </text>
<text> If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear? </text>
<text> Looking for Rya? Still hanging around on the high road, I suppose. </text>
<text> Oh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine... </text>
<text> Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium! </text>
<text> You're...making your way to the Erdtree, no? </text>
<text> Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination. </text>
<text> Have you ever seen an iron virgin? </text>
<text> The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels. </text>
<text> ...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition. </text>
<text> And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> Its transpositional powers fully intact. </text>
<text> So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose... </text>
<text> It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told... </text>
<text> Ha ha...ha ha... </text>
<text> Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like. </text>
<text> There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Heh heh...ha ha... </text>
<text> Well, fancy meeting you here. </text>
<text> Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend. </text>
<text> I spoke no lie, not a one. </text>
<text> You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake, </text>
<text> but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out. </text>
<text> I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear. </text>
<text> But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right? </text>
<text> Oh, erm, hello, yes. </text>
<text> Strange place for a chance encounter, eh? </text>
<text> Thought I could use a rest. Don't mind me, go about your business. </text>
<text> Right, over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear. </text>
<text> Heh heh heh... </text>
<text> What is it? Oh, don't mind me. Off you trot. </text>
<text> Right over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear. </text>
<text> Heh heh heh... </text>
<text> Oh, my, well, here you are again. </text>
<text> So sorry for that. I meant to warn you, but whoops! There you went. </text>
<text> Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have. </text>
<text> But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh. </text>
<text> And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different! </text>
<text> Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion. </text>
<text> I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals. </text>
<text> Mm...heh heh... </text>
<text> You didn't listen last time, but I'm warning you again. </text>
<text> Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion. </text>
<text> I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals. </text>
<text> Heh heh...heh heh... </text>
<text> Well, you've joined the Manor, eh? </text>
<text> I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you. </text>
<text> And here I thought Rya was barking up the wrong tree... </text>
<text> All good, though. We're on the same side, now. </text>
<text> We'll do good work together. </text>
<text> Oh, and of course, we can do business, if you like. </text>
<text> Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you. </text>
<text> Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing. </text>
<text> This is for you. </text>
<text> You're new here at the Manor. </text>
<text> But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing. </text>
<text> Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right? </text>
<text> Go on, break a leg, then. </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey? </text>
<text> Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon. </text>
<text> We're not here to make your life easier. </text>
<text> Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with? </text>
<text> You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with? </text>
<text> You hunted down Tragoth? </text>
<text> Are you certain? </text>
<text> No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed. </text>
<text> I'll give Tanith the news. </text>
<text> Have some rest, by all means. </text>
<text> Are you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers. </text>
<text> I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade. </text>
<text> Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious. </text>
<text> I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it. </text>
<text> Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud. </text>
<text> I've never seen a woman quite like her... </text>
<text> Hmph. </text>
<text> Sharper than you seem, aren't you... </text>
<text> I was just holding onto it for you, you know. </text>
<text> Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours. </text>
<text> Now you've gone and killed Rykard? </text>
<text> You scheming little bastard. </text>
<text> You scheming little doxie. </text>
<text> Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical... </text>
<text> Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all... </text>
<text> But for now, this Manor is finished. </text>
<text> The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head. </text>
<text> A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy. </text>
<text> Heh heh...ha ha... </text>
<text> Well, here I am. Untethered, once again. </text>
<text> Good-bye, my friend. </text>
<text> What is it? </text>
<text> Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium? </text>
<text> Ah, oh, you again... </text>
<text> A shame you had to see me like this... </text>
<text> Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all. </text>
<text> I should have stuck to what I know best... </text>
<text> No matter. I know I-I can trust you. </text>
<text> Gullible, yes, but a good soul. </text>
<text> Make certain that Tanith gets this. </text>
<text> Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape. </text>
<text> C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong. </text>
<text> You're able, then? </text>
<text> Then I can rest easy, my friend... </text>
<text> Well, well, well? </text>
<text> Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings? </text>
<text> You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance! </text>
<text> Cough up your coin, all of it! </text>
<text> Hm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you? </text>
<text> Oh, cripes, please, wait! </text>
<text> I surrender! I surrender, I swear! </text>
<text> Do you even hear me? I said "surrender", loud and clear! </text>
<text> No one likes a bull-headed brute! </text>
<text> You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you? </text>
<text> Cripes! Are you dense, mate? </text>
<text> What in the world has gotten into you! </text>
<text> Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming. </text>
<text> Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch! </text>
<text> Well, glad to see we're on the same page. </text>
<text> I'd never cross you, not even close. </text>
<text> He he he... </text>
<text> Ahhh... </text>
<text> It's been ages since I've seen you. </text>
<text> I didn't even realise it was you. </text>
<text> Took you for a demi-human, or some such. </text>
<text> You know how it is, just an innocent mistake. </text>
<text> Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual? </text>
<text> Hell's bells... </text>
<text> This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be... </text>
<text> Especially if we keep running into the likes of you... </text>
<text> ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads... </text>
<text> ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads... </text>
<text> Well, finally made it, eh, and just in time. </text>
<text> For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium. </text>
<text> Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch! </text>
<text> Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium. </text>
<text> Cheers for that. </text>
<text> What, do I have to beg? </text>
<text> Give us a coin or two next time around, will you? </text>
<text> Forgot something on your shopping list? </text>
<text> No trouble to me. </text>
<text> Booze, eh? Good stuff, by the look of it. </text>
<text> But, er, I'm alright, thanks. </text>
<text> As my dear nan used to say, "there's no such thing as a free lunch"... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> What are you playing at? That bloody well hurts! </text>
<text> What's wrong with you? </text>
<text> It's me, Patches. Patches! </text>
<text> Enough now, stop! </text>
<text> Ugh. Hard of hearing, are we? </text>
<text> Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming! </text>
<text> Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch! </text>
<text> Last chance to surrender, mate. </text>
<text> Grovel...and I'll forgive you. </text>
<text> Well... It was bound to happen some day... </text>
<text> What a shit show... </text>
<text> Try not to be so slow on the uptake, eh. </text>
<text> There's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you. </text>
<text> Well, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Water under the bridge. Am I wrong? </text>
<text> We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know. </text>
<text> So, what can I do you for today? </text>
<text> Okay, I can see you mean it. </text>
<text> Consider it water under the bridge. </text>
<text> A momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know. </text>
<text> So. Do you need something from me? </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Hello? Is somebody there? </text>
<text> Might I bend your ear for a moment, please. </text>
<text> My name is Irina. I've escaped from Castle Morne, to the south. </text>
<text> The servants there...have rebelled. </text>
<text> I-I can't be sure what it is; my eyesight's been weak since birth you see... </text>
<text> But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over. </text>
<text> My good father secreted me out the castle, </text>
<text> but decided himself to stay. He says it's his duty, as commander. </text>
<text> I understand. </text>
<text> I fear some of the castle's servants are still prowling nearby. </text>
<text> Do take care on the road. I pray your journey comes to fruition. </text>
<text> And if you happen to change your mind... </text>
<text> Please come to see me again. </text>
<text> Hello? Is somebody there? </text>
<text> Ah, you're the one from before, aren't you? </text>
<text> Please, I implore you. </text>
<text> Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle? </text>
<text> My sole wish is that he escape,<br>even if his honour should be the price. </text>
<text> Please...I just need him to be safe... </text>
<text> Thank you, dearly. </text>
<text> Then please, take this. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please. </text>
<text> Please, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle. </text>
<text> He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around. </text>
<text> I...I fear for father's life. </text>
<text> The servants are full wroth. Filled with hatred for every one of us. </text>
<text> They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with.<br>They haven't spared a soul. </text>
<text> I fear it's no different at Castle Morne... </text>
<text> Please, I implore you. </text>
<text> Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle? </text>
<text> My sole wish is that he escape,<br>even if his honour should be the price. </text>
<text> Please...I just want him to be safe... </text>
<text> Hello? Is someone there? </text>
<text> My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light. </text>
<text> If I might be so bold as to ask... </text>
<text> Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me? </text>
<text> My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see.<br>I can't tell which way I'm supposed to go next. </text>
<text> But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light<br>in the back of my eyes. </text>
<text> It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden. </text>
<text> Hello? Is someone there? </text>
<text> Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me? </text>
<text> I'm on a pilgrimage in search of the distant light. </text>
<text> And when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel the light<br>in the back of my eyes. </text>
<text> Oh, many thanks to you. </text>
<text> Now I can feel the distant light once more. </text>
<text> You are most kind, indeed. </text>
<text> May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. </text>
<text> You're not like the others who give me grapes, are you... </text>
<text> They rest their trembling hands upon me. </text>
<text> Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes. </text>
<text> Their frail fingers, emaciated... Yet still, they give me the grapes. </text>
<text> But you...seem somehow...firmer. </text>
<text> Oh, many thanks to you. </text>
<text> Now I can feel the distant light once more. </text>
<text> That aside, I wonder what Shabriri grapes really are? </text>
<text> Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing... </text>
<text> What a sight they must be to behold. </text>
<text> N-No... That's not possible... </text>
<text> Not all of those people... Their own... </text>
<text> So those noises I heard were... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> &lt;retching&gt; </text>
<text> Sorry... I'm alright now. </text>
<text> Don't mind me... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ah, is that you over there? </text>
<text> I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you. </text>
<text> The reason why it was eyes I had to eat. </text>
<text> The distant light is far and frail. </text>
<text> So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye. </text>
<text> But with everyone's eyes together, it appears. </text>
<text> Finally, it all makes sense. </text>
<text> I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden. </text>
<text> You are most kind, indeed. </text>
<text> May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. </text>
<text> You are most kind, indeed. </text>
<text> May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. </text>
<text> I wonder, what are Shabriri grapes? </text>
<text> Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing... </text>
<text> What a sight they must be to behold. </text>
<text> I apologise. You only did as I asked. </text>
<text> I'll be fine. Think no more of it. </text>
<text> I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you. </text>
<text> I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden. </text>
<text> Oh hello, is that you over there? </text>
<text> Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes? </text>
<text> They're special grapes which only grow on those<br>who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers... </text>
<text> I would truly love to try one... </text>
<text> The distant light seems far closer than before, </text>
<text> But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore... </text>
<text> Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me? </text>
<text> Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad. </text>
<text> Oh, Oh! </text>
<text> A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape! </text>
<text> Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns... </text>
<text> Thank you. I've composed myself again. </text>
<text> May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. </text>
<text> Oh, that's right. </text>
<text> ...Might I ask a boon of you? </text>
<text> Look after this for me, if you please. </text>
<text> It's been so long, I don't know how I came upon it,<br>but I've been looking for its owner. </text>
<text> Now I'm to be a Maiden though, it'll never find its way home. </text>
<text> Which is why I'd like you to have it. </text>
<text> It must be very, very precious indeed. </text>
<text> They're special grapes which only grow on those<br>who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers... </text>
<text> Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me? </text>
<text> Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad. </text>
<text> Thank you from the bottom of my heart. </text>
<text> I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden. </text>
<text> Ah, so you're here as well, are you? </text>
<text> ...I realised as we've talked. </text>
<text> I'll be a Maiden, and you... Surely, a Lord. </text>
<text> Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions. </text>
<text> It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you. </text>
<text> May the flame of chaos find purchase within you. </text>
<text> Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions. </text>
<text> It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you. </text>
<text> Ahh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you. </text>
<text> Could you please rest your hand upon me? </text>
<text> Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden... </text>
<text> Oh, it burns... </text>
<text> My eyes, my eyes, they're melting... </text>
<text> Aaargh! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Could you please rest your hand upon me? </text>
<text> Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Thank...thank you... </text>
<text> I have touched them. The words of the Three Fingers. </text>
<text> As your maiden, allow me to divine them. </text>
<text> All that there is came from the One Great. </text>
<text> Then came fractures, and births, and souls. </text>
<text> But the Greater Will made a mistake. </text>
<text> Torment, despair, affliction. Every sin, every curse. </text>
<text> Every one, born of the mistake. </text>
<text> And so, what was borrowed must be returned. </text>
<text> Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame. </text>
<text> Until all is One again. </text>
<text> Those who gave me grapes howled without words. </text>
<text> Saying they wished they were never born. </text>
<text> Become their lord. </text>
<text> Take their torment, despair. Their affliction. Every sin, every curse. </text>
<text> And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos. </text>
<text> No more fractures. No more birth... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Agh! </text>
<text> What's happened to you? </text>
<text> Please, you must stop this. </text>
<text> Ah, why on earth? </text>
<text> I do not wish to cause anyone harm. </text>
<text> Oh, bless the stars. </text>
<text> You've chosen to reconsider. </text>
<text> Father... </text>
<text> Please, be safe... </text>
<text> Ahh, the distant light...fades... </text>
<text> I'm so sorry, my dears... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Ah, there's a face I've not seen before. </text>
<text> I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself. </text>
<text> But you can see how things have turned out. </text>
<text> The menials have all rebelled. </text>
<text> They gave me good service, or so I thought,<br>but it seems it was all an act. </text>
<text> Foul creatures, as it's said.<br>And true enough they're foul inside and out. </text>
<text> I'm sorry to disappoint you, </text>
<text> But whatever you've come here to do,<br>I'm afraid Castle Morne won't hold much longer. </text>
<text> Take this, by way of apology. </text>
<text> Now then, away with you. </text>
<text> You've no reason to risk your neck dawdling here, eh. </text>
<text> I see, from Irina... </text>
<text> Thank you. I'm in your debt. </text>
<text> But I can't leave yet. </text>
<text> Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain. </text>
<text> To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands. </text>
<text> If you see Irina, do tell her. </text>
<text> That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty. </text>
<text> I'm in your debt. </text>
<text> For keeping the sword from those fallen creatures. </text>
<text> I'm no longer bound by duty. </text>
<text> Once I've rescued Irina, I will spend my remaining days with her. </text>
<text> Thanks to you, I will be reunited with Irina. </text>
<text> And devote my remaining days to her. </text>
<text> Irina has a gentle nature, though. </text>
<text> I only hope it remains intact. </text>
<text> Irina... </text>
<text> How could this be… </text>
<text> My daughter deserved better… </text>
<text> The fault lies...with me. </text>
<text> I chose duty over my daughter's safety. </text>
<text> And that is how fate has answered… </text>
<text> I'll find them. </text>
<text> The foul wretches responsible for this. </text>
<text> I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them. </text>
<text> Rest assured, Irina. It will be done. </text>
<text> Ugh! </text>
<text> What's this about? </text>
<text> We need not fight, I assure you. </text>
<text> I haven't a clue what's got into you, </text>
<text> but as Lord of this castle, I will stand for it no longer! </text>
<text> And now even your ilk have complicated matters. </text>
<text> Please, enlighten me. </text>
<text> What was the purpose of such folly? </text>
<text> Please forgive me, Lord Godrick. </text>
<text> No, not here, not yet… </text>
<text> Forgive me, Iri…na… </text>
<text> Ugh! </text>
<text> What's the matter? </text>
<text> Cease this at once. </text>
<text> Ah, now I see! </text>
<text> You had a hand in Irina's undoing! </text>
<text> What could she have done to deserve that? </text>
<text> I will not rest until they are eliminated. </text>
<text> Forgive me, Irina… </text>
<text> I will join you soon enough… </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Oh, Tarnished, are you? </text>
<text> How did you slip inside, with the gate closed? </text>
<text> Hmph. No matter. </text>
<text> If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book. </text>
<text> I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. </text>
<text> Incidentally, do you like a good festival, from time to time? </text>
<text> Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. </text>
<text> But when the stars align, we celebrate. </text>
<text> A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn, </text>
<text> the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune. </text>
<text> Well, good. </text>
<text> As you should. The festival affords glory to warriors. </text>
<text> Then all you need is a little patience. </text>
<text> When the stars align, the festival will be declared. </text>
<text> Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum? </text>
<text> No matter. One day you will see. </text>
<text> That true warriors bask in glory at the festival. </text>
<text> Have patience, mm. </text>
<text> When the stars align, the festival will be declared. </text>
<text> Go on, now. </text>
<text> This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet. </text>
<text> One day you will see, chum. </text>
<text> That true warriors bask in glory at the festival. </text>
<text> Go on, now. </text>
<text> This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet. </text>
<text> Well, I haven't heard that name in an age. </text>
<text> Then you must serve Princess Ranni? </text>
<text> The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this: </text>
<text> The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate back into motion. </text>
<text> By the by… Is that old fool still hammering out weapons? </text>
<text> His enormous frame, cramped in that little place... </text>
<text> Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him. </text>
<text> And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone. </text>
<text> But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot... </text>
<text> Champions, welcome! </text>
<text> The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh! </text>
<text> General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you! </text>
<text> Champions, prepare for battle! Defeat the General, claim glory, and grab that Great Rune! </text>
<text> A celebration of war! The Radahn Festival! </text>
<text> Are you good and prepared, young chum? </text>
<text> The festival begins! </text>
<text> But now, we must make merry. </text>
<text> O gathering of champions, the revels begin! </text>
<text> The celebration of war! The Radahn Festival! </text>
<text> You will find the field of battle past the church ahead, upon the shore under the fort. </text>
<text> General Radahn is there, even now. </text>
<text> Divested of his wits, devouring corpses… </text>
<text> And howling at the sky... </text>
<text> I see... </text>
<text> When you are ready, come to me again. </text>
<text> At last, the war festival has ended. </text>
<text> Brave champion, you have our gratitude. </text>
<text> The celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased. </text>
<text> Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honourable death. </text>
<text> Finally, my work is done. </text>
<text> I am no longer bound to this fortress. </text>
<text> I have a task in mind. </text>
<text> Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand. </text>
<text> May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion. </text>
<text> It's time I went on my way. </text>
<text> May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion. </text>
<text> Ah, well met. </text>
<text> I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places. </text>
<text> You didn't...know Sellen, did you? </text>
<text> Well, whatever the case, she's dead now. </text>
<text> Just put it behind you. </text>
<text> She was known as the Graven Witch. </text>
<text> Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hand. </text>
<text> The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy. </text>
<text> Oh, a Tarnished, are you? </text>
<text> You didn't...know Sellen, did you? </text>
<text> It is strange, though... </text>
<text> The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled. </text>
<text> I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere. </text>
<text> I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body. </text>
<text> A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me. </text>
<text> I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere. </text>
<text> I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body. </text>
<text> A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me. </text>
<text> My thanks, for the aid given. </text>
<text> I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion. </text>
<text> But I didn't know he was talking about you. </text>
<text> You've helped me fulfil an old promise. </text>
<text> This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. </text>
<text> My thanks, for the aid given. </text>
<text> Always a pleasure to witness the festival champ put on a display. </text>
<text> You've helped me fulfil an old promise. </text>
<text> This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. </text>
<text> My thanks, Tarnished, for the aid given. </text>
<text> You've helped me fulfil an old promise. </text>
<text> This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. </text>
<text> Well, I must be leaving now. </text>
<text> Brave warrior, if the fates deign it... </text>
<text> No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney. </text>
<text> Well, I must be leaving now. </text>
<text> If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished. </text>
<text> Ugh! </text>
<text> What's the matter with you? </text>
<text> You trying to get revenge? </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> If the Graven Witch put you under her spell, you must be eliminated... </text>
<text> Before you can pose a threat to Caria. </text>
<text> Rest now. Alongside the witch's corpse. </text>
<text> You...are a menace... </text>
<text> Iji...beware... </text>
<text> Sellen, Graven Witch, enemy of Caria. </text>
<text> I vow this time to crush both your frame and your primal glintstone. </text>
<text> I am Jerren, bringer of your death. Do not forget. </text>
<text> You must be eliminated... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Hello... Hello... </text>
<text> Please... Over here... </text>
<text> Hello... Hello... </text>
<text> Right over here... </text>
<text> Hello. </text>
<text> It's rather chilly here, isn't it? </text>
<text> My mistress sent me off on an errand... </text>
<text> But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind. </text>
<text> Could I ask you lend a hand, perhaps? </text>
<text> That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it. </text>
<text> I would be sure to provide ample reward. </text>
<text> Only... He, too, is Tarnished. </text>
<text> If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another... </text>
<text> Ohh, thank you dearly. </text>
<text> What a blessing that we've met like this. </text>
<text> The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way... </text>
<text> Please, I must have the necklace back. </text>
<text> Yes, I see. Most unfortunate, but I'll have to make do. </text>
<text> I know that some Tarnished balk at the thought of harming their own. </text>
<text> But if you should change your mind, do not hesitate to speak to me again. </text>
<text> Have you had a change of heart? </text>
<text> The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way... </text>
<text> Please, I must have the necklace back. </text>
<text> Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace. </text>
<text> Thank you kindly. I am in your debt. </text>
<text> Did I forget to announce myself? </text>
<text> I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house. </text>
<text> You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand, </text>
<text> but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. </text>
<text> Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks. </text>
<text> Please, take this. </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree... </text>
<text> But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven, </text>
<text> the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions. </text>
<text> Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you... </text>
<text> This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road. </text>
<text> But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage. </text>
<text> Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff. </text>
<text> At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel. </text>
<text> It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau. </text>
<text> I have faith in you. A champion, through and through. </text>
<text> I do hope that we can meet again. </text>
<text> I've been waiting for you. </text>
<text> I knew you had the stuff of champions. </text>
<text> I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress. </text>
<text> I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Speak to me again once you are ready. </text>
<text> You will find me here. </text>
<text> Are you ready, then? </text>
<text> I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress. </text>
<text> I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> Give me your hand. </text>
<text> I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> Hello... Hello... </text>
<text> Right over here... </text>
<text> But I hardly hold him in high regard. </text>
<text> He seems to bear animosity toward the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Perhaps it is to be expected, only... </text>
<text> his intent, while vicious, is also tenuous, as if his heart is not in it. </text>
<text> Doesn't really seem like champion material, to me... </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished, what is your business here? </text>
<text> I'm afraid this is not a guest room. </text>
<text> What's that peculiar look upon your face? </text>
<text> &lt;gasp&gt; </text>
<text> Goodness, am I still a serpent? </text>
<text> Oh, how dreadful... </text>
<text> How dreadful indeed... </text>
<text> Forgive my distress. </text>
<text> I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance. </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished. </text>
<text> This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas. </text>
<text> Please forgive the deception. </text>
<text> Do understand. This duplicity is my own doing. </text>
<text> Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems. </text>
<text> Lady Tanith is my mother. </text>
<text> I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king. </text>
<text> That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. </text>
<text> I am proud of what I am. </text>
<text> But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, they wouldn't speak to me. </text>
<text> And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits. </text>
<text> But you are not like the rest. </text>
<text> My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas, </text>
<text> were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I. </text>
<text> Now I share the secrets with you, as well. </text>
<text> Please keep them safe from anyone else. </text>
<text> Seek the old ruins in the cliff. </text>
<text> At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel. </text>
<text> It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau. </text>
<text> I have faith in you. A champion, through and through. </text>
<text> I do hope that we can meet again. </text>
<text> Hello again. Brave Tarnished. </text>
<text> As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. </text>
<text> Have you ever... </text>
<text> heard any strange sounds here at the manor? </text>
<text> Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales... </text>
<text> Oh fie, what am I saying? </text>
<text> It just isn't possible. I must be tired. </text>
<text> Um, oh, it's you. </text>
<text> Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late. </text>
<text> Hmm, well... </text>
<text> I know I can trust you... </text>
<text> I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night. </text>
<text> It entered the room across the hall, and never came out. </text>
<text> If I'm not mistaken, </text>
<text> it took the form of a serpent, just like me... </text>
<text> Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret, </text>
<text> that Lady Tanith has kept from me? </text>
<text> I realise that I shouldn't impose but, </text>
<text> if you discover anything, would you please share? </text>
<text> It entered the room next to this one, and never came out. </text>
<text> The serpent that lurked in the shadows that night... </text>
<text> It entered the room across the hall, and never came out. </text>
<text> Perhaps the manor yet holds some secrets. </text>
<text> If you discover anything, would you please share? </text>
<text> It entered the room next to this one, and never came out. </text>
<text> Really... </text>
<text> Oh, so there was a secret after all... </text>
<text> Oh my... </text>
<text> Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me... </text>
<text> Was I not... </text>
<text> born by the grace of a king? </text>
<text> Hello again. Brave Tarnished. </text>
<text> It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand, </text>
<text> but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. </text>
<text> Hello again. Brave Tarnished. </text>
<text> Do you remember me? I am Rya. We spoke once in Liurnia. </text>
<text> I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. </text>
<text> A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished. </text>
<text> I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished. </text>
<text> Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. </text>
<text> Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls. </text>
<text> Like breathing, or slithering scales. </text>
<text> Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired. </text>
<text> Hmm, what is this? </text>
<text> I remember this scent, distinctly. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Funny, isn't it. </text>
<text> I am certain of it. I was born inside this. </text>
<text> It's a part of my birth mother. </text>
<text> You have my gratitude. </text>
<text> Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid. </text>
<text> I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart. </text>
<text> Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me... </text>
<text> Was I not... </text>
<text> born by the grace of a king? </text>
<text> I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart. </text>
<text> Oh, it's you... </text>
<text> I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you. </text>
<text> I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual. </text>
<text> Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents. </text>
<text> Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me. </text>
<text> You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand, </text>
<text> but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. </text>
<text> I know that you have done so much for me. </text>
<text> But I wish to ask one last kindness. </text>
<text> Kill me, please. </text>
<text> I thought that I feared nothing. But this... </text>
<text> Free me from this accursed frame. </text>
<text> Agh... </text>
<text> Thank you... My champion... </text>
<text> Mother... </text>
<text> I'm to drink this, then? </text>
<text> Yes, of course. You always were very kind. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ahh... How delightfully sweet... </text>
<text> And yet... </text>
<text> I know that you have done so much for me. </text>
<text> But I wish to ask one last kindness. </text>
<text> Kill me, please. </text>
<text> I thought that I feared nothing. But this... </text>
<text> Free me from this accursed frame. </text>
<text> You're not willing to kill me, are you. </text>
<text> Hah... </text>
<text> You've always been so kind. And uncompromising. </text>
<text> I suppose I knew in my heart of hearts. </text>
<text> How kind, and uncompromising, you always were. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Oh, it's you. </text>
<text> Heaven knows what happened here, </text>
<text> but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone. </text>
<text> It feels rather quiet without them. </text>
<text> But with you here, things will be just fine. </text>
<text> I await Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king. </text>
<text> I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern. </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour. </text>
<text> I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes. </text>
<text> Please, stop, Brave Tarnished. </text>
<text> You will only tire by striking this barrier. </text>
<text> Besides, I am no foe of yours. </text>
<text> Please, think this over. </text>
<text> I see that you have reconsidered. </text>
<text> Thank goodness. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Ah, hello. You must be new here. </text>
<text> I'm... </text>
<text> Well, just call me Diallos. </text>
<text> The honor of one's house holds little import in these lands. </text>
<text> By the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels? </text>
<text> She's my servant, but fickle as the wind. </text>
<text> Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone. </text>
<text> If you find her, please be sure to tell me. </text>
<text> Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya. </text>
<text> She's a servant to my house. </text>
<text> She's been my companion since childhood. </text>
<text> I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this. </text>
<text> Honestly, she's such a little tomboy. </text>
<text> Lanya... Lanya... </text>
<text> It's me, Diallos. Answer me, would you? </text>
<text> Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you. </text>
<text> The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.<br>The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished. </text>
<text> They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,<br>and I refuse to let the insult stand. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood. </text>
<text> I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. </text>
<text> Ah, you again, is it? </text>
<text> The recusants sent a lackey. </text>
<text> Can you believe they invited me to join them?<br>Now! After what they did... </text>
<text> I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool? </text>
<text> You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer. </text>
<text> Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout. </text>
<text> It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west<br>from the town of windmills. </text>
<text> That's where they hide. The manor on the peak. </text>
<text> Just you wait, wretched recusants. </text>
<text> You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood after all. </text>
<text> Who on earth are you? </text>
<text> Hmph, never mind. But tell me if you know, would you. </text>
<text> The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.<br>The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished. </text>
<text> They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,<br>and I refuse to let the insult stand. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood. </text>
<text> I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. </text>
<text> They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,<br>and I refuse to let the insult stand. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood. </text>
<text> I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. </text>
<text> It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west<br>from the town of windmills. </text>
<text> That's where they hide. The manor on the peak. </text>
<text> Just you wait, wretched recusants. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood after all. </text>
<text> Ah. Oh... I-it's you, is it? </text>
<text> Well. Nice to see you again. </text>
<text> So you've been invited as well, I see. </text>
<text> Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth.<br>You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes? </text>
<text> I, um, I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya... </text>
<text> Well, you see, I... </text>
<text> After much internal debate, I've come to realise... </text>
<text> Revenge is not the answer. </text>
<text> According to Lady Tanith... </text>
<text> I've got the stuff of champions. </text>
<text> And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path. </text>
<text> It hit me like a bolt from the blue... </text>
<text> That my former thoughts were simple naiveté. </text>
<text> Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya. </text>
<text> That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed. </text>
<text> But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't<br>make me a champion, will it. </text>
<text> Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both. </text>
<text> But such is true of any road trod by champions. </text>
<text> I always resented these hands. </text>
<text> Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow. </text>
<text> But that won't be the case for long. </text>
<text> They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood after all. </text>
<text> Ah, it's you, is it. </text>
<text> I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself? </text>
<text> I haven't achieved anything at all thus far. </text>
<text> Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again. </text>
<text> I'm still yet to achieve anything. </text>
<text> Perhaps I am a fool after all... </text>
<text> No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the<br>path of revenge and sullied the name of my house. </text>
<text> What an easy mark I must have been... </text>
<text> How did it take me so long to realise, honestly... </text>
<text> There's just no end to my foolishness, is there... </text>
<text> It's just as my noble brother says. </text>
<text> I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become<br>a champion. </text>
<text> Perhaps I am a fool after all... </text>
<text> No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the<br>path of revenge and sullied the name of my house. </text>
<text> What an easy mark I must have been... </text>
<text> Well. Aren't you full of beans. </text>
<text> No wonder you're covered in muck. </text>
<text> Oh? My friend, it's been far too long. </text>
<text> I have to say you caught me at a rather low point. </text>
<text> But...as you see, I've put all that behind me. </text>
<text> Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now.<br>Making my own choices. </text>
<text> Even a fool like me can look after some simple jars. </text>
<text> Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time<br>in my life I'm on the straight and narrow. </text>
<text> A fool I may be, but I can look after some simple jars. </text>
<text> Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time<br>in my life I'm on the straight and narrow. </text>
<text> ...Ah, you... </text>
<text> Are the jars...they alright? </text>
<text> Did I defend them? </text>
<text> Then all is well... </text>
<text> This fool proved his worth, in the end... </text>
<text> Ha...ha ha... </text>
<text> I see... I see... </text>
<text> I've been a fool...to the last... </text>
<text> Agh! </text>
<text> What on earth was that for! </text>
<text> Now I see. You're a wretched recusant! </text>
<text> May you rue the day that you thought to trample me! </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! </text>
<text> In blood! </text>
<text> Lanya, your honour has been restored. </text>
<text> As a charge of House Hoslow, you can rest easy. </text>
<text> Ha ha...ha... </text>
<text> I am the shame of House Hoslow after all... </text>
<text> Ugh! </text>
<text> What's the matter? Please, stop! </text>
<text> I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> I will never brandish a sword again, I swear! </text>
<text> Why on earth...? </text>
<text> Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you? </text>
<text> I'll turn my back on duty no more. </text>
<text> The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! </text>
<text> In blood! </text>
<text> Unharmed, thank the stars. </text>
<text> Ahh, just what I deserve... </text>
<text> For absconding from my duties... </text>
<text> I'm sorry, my dear jars... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here. </text>
<text> I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly. </text>
<text> Why are you here? </text>
<text> Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries? </text>
<text> Well, your aptitude does appear...passable. </text>
<text> But one must choose one's masters wisely. </text>
<text> I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, </text>
<text> as a reviled, apostate witch. </text>
<text> Do you still wish to learn from me? </text>
<text> Well, you are a piece of work. </text>
<text> Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery. </text>
<text> But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never. </text>
<text> Anticipate grievances, young apprentice. </text>
<text> Really. </text>
<text> It's not every day I meet a Tarnished just milling about. </text>
<text> What is it now? Why are you here again? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> You are quite the enigma, aren't you... </text>
<text> I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal... </text>
<text> Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature, with a bit of luck. </text>
<text> Yes, I think that would be wise. </text>
<text> We must choose our masters wisely. </text>
<text> Well? Have you made up your mind? </text>
<text> Young apprentice. First things first. </text>
<text> You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk. </text>
<text> So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance. </text>
<text> Now, shall we start learning? </text>
<text> There you are, my apprentice. </text>
<text> Shall we commence the lesson? </text>
<text> You wish to continue the lesson? </text>
<text> Very well, I have time aplenty. </text>
<text> Our art draws upon the powers embedded in glintstone. </text>
<text> But what is the nature of such power? </text>
<text> Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos. </text>
<text> Golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life, and houses its vitality, </text>
<text> while glintstone contains residual life, and thus the vitality of the stars. </text>
<text> It should not be forgotten, </text>
<text> that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein. </text>
<text> A fact lost on most sorcerers, these days... </text>
<text> Your appetite for learning is impressive. </text>
<text> You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily. </text>
<text> You must have a fabulous teacher. </text>
<text> Hmm? What's on your mind? </text>
<text> Well, well... </text>
<text> Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again... </text>
<text> But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. </text>
<text> The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni. </text>
<text> But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles. </text>
<text> Now, he is the force that repulses the stars. </text>
<text> If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement. </text>
<text> And so, too, would Ranni's destiny. </text>
<text> My apprentice, what happened to your nail? </text>
<text> Perhaps you have a different view, but... </text>
<text> That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn. </text>
<text> May I remove it for you? </text>
<text> A wise choice. Let me neutralize it. </text>
<text> But first... </text>
<text> Listen up, wretched curse-peddler. </text>
<text> This is a vile craft in which you engage. </text>
<text> Let it be known. </text>
<text> This is the beloved apprentice of Sellen, Graven Witch. </text>
<text> I set a curse upon you and your meddling hand. </text>
<text> Your death will not be a pleasant one. </text>
<text> May you shudder between breaths in your sleep... </text>
<text> If you prefer not, that is your prerogative. </text>
<text> But let it be known. </text>
<text> That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn. </text>
<text> If what I have told you one day rings true, </text>
<text> by all means, come to me again. </text>
<text> What's this sorcery, my apprentice? </text>
<text> Ah, then you have seen Master Azur. </text>
<text> Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher. </text>
<text> A stern judge of men, but he must see something in you. </text>
<text> You make us both proud. </text>
<text> We can speak more later, my apprentice. </text>
<text> If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. </text>
<text> The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. </text>
<text> I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. </text>
<text> No matter what we give in return. </text>
<text> My apprentice. I presume nothing. </text>
<text> Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path. </text>
<text> But hear me out, my apprentice. </text>
<text> I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. </text>
<text> Perhaps this is a journey we could take together? </text>
<text> Splendid. I thank you. </text>
<text> This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. </text>
<text> You must have a fabulous teacher. </text>
<text> Forgive me, it was an outlandish idea to begin with. </text>
<text> And I fear quite presumptuous of me, as well. </text>
<text> Don't give it another thought, my apprentice. </text>
<text> Really? My apprentice. </text>
<text> You must have given this quite some thought. </text>
<text> Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me. </text>
<text> It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. </text>
<text> There you are, my apprentice. </text>
<text> Shall we commence the lesson? </text>
<text> You wish to resume the lesson? </text>
<text> Indeed, that would be the wiser option. </text>
<text> I need your help, my apprentice. </text>
<text> Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer. </text>
<text> And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere. </text>
<text> My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat? </text>
<text> With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him. </text>
<text> I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. </text>
<text> He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now... </text>
<text> After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home. </text>
<text> A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer. </text>
<text> It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby... </text>
<text> Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat... </text>
<text> You have my gratitude. This is all your work. </text>
<text> I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit. </text>
<text> This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it. </text>
<text> This brings us a full step closer. </text>
<text> The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the Academy. </text>
<text> If only I could undo these wretched shackles... </text>
<text> This brings us a full step closer. </text>
<text> The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy. </text>
<text> If only I could undo these wretched shackles... </text>
<text> My apprentice. Give me a moment later. </text>
<text> I have a favour to ask. </text>
<text> The form you see before you is merely a projection. </text>
<text> My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved. </text>
<text> My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, </text>
<text> imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. </text>
<text> Can you make the journey to my body? </text>
<text> I have something that I can only trust with you. </text>
<text> My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, </text>
<text> imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. </text>
<text> Can you make the journey to my body? </text>
<text> I have something that I can only trust with you. </text>
<text> My apprentice, thank you for coming. </text>
<text> These shackles take a toll on us all. </text>
<text> There is something I need you to look after. </text>
<text> My primal glintstone. </text>
<text> A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver. </text>
<text> Someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you. </text>
<text> My self. </text>
<text> &lt;groaning in pain&gt; </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> &lt;panting&gt; </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Thank you...my apprentice... </text>
<text> This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care. </text>
<text> &lt;shivering moans&gt; </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> It will do no good, I swear it... </text>
<text> ...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates... </text>
<text> A...argh! </text>
<text> &lt;shivering moans&gt; </text>
<text> Treat it with care, my apprentice... </text>
<text> What you hold is my very being... </text>
<text> My apprentice, just how long has it been? </text>
<text> Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again. </text>
<text> And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone. </text>
<text> Better still, I've shed those awful shackles. </text>
<text> Finally, I can return to the academy. </text>
<text> To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. </text>
<text> My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you. </text>
<text> Finally, I can return to the academy. </text>
<text> To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. </text>
<text> My apprentice, shall we commence the lesson? </text>
<text> As thanks for procuring this new form, I'll be holding you to a higher standard. </text>
<text> You wish to resume the lesson? </text>
<text> Have I not been strict enough, I wonder? </text>
<text> Ahh, my apprentice. </text>
<text> You've saved my skin once again. </text>
<text> Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more. </text>
<text> With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current. </text>
<text> So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again. </text>
<text> My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy? </text>
<text> Oh, I know it's not possible. </text>
<text> You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord. </text>
<text> But do think of me. </text>
<text> Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning. </text>
<text> You will always be my darling pupil. </text>
<text> Rest assured that I... </text>
<text> No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch. </text>
<text> My apprentice. Become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Hmm, perhaps I'm jumping ahead, </text>
<text> but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's. </text>
<text> Do you recall what once I told you? </text>
<text> That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein. </text>
<text> When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me. </text>
<text> Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Next time, I will be your student. </text>
<text> Oh, one last thing. </text>
<text> If you fail to claim your throne, </text>
<text> you can always pay me a visit. </text>
<text> Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> What is it? My apprentice. </text>
<text> Ahh, I am glad to see you. My apprentice. </text>
<text> Would you like a lesson? I'm always glad to further your education. </text>
<text> It warms my heart. That you still think of me. </text>
<text> Yet I still yearn, for you to find Master Lusat. </text>
<text> His body is needed. At the academy, to hone the primeval current... </text>
<text> Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat... </text>
<text> Oh, this is wonderful news. Now, his body will be brought home. </text>
<text> And when the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat are together, the academy can hone the primeval current. </text>
<text> So that we, fallen children of the stars, will beam once again. </text>
<text> I am most grateful. There are no others who would have done this. </text>
<text> What a joy to have you as an apprentice, and kindred spirit. </text>
<text> This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it. </text>
<text> You wish to resume the lesson? </text>
<text> Good. Indeed, it is better to finish what one starts, is it not? </text>
<text> With the body of Master Azur returned, the academy can restore the primeval current. </text>
<text> So that we, fallen children of the stars, might beam with brilliance once again. </text>
<text> Jerren, bringer of my death. </text>
<text> You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles. </text>
<text> But I am afraid your work is done. </text>
<text> Join the school. To reflect on your mistake. </text>
<text> U...urgh </text>
<text> M-my...apprentice... </text>
<text> I-I'm... </text>
<text> My...apprentice... </text>
<text> Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days. </text>
<text> Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar. </text>
<text> I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons. </text>
<text> Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice. </text>
<text> What's the meaning of this? </text>
<text> How unfortunate. </text>
<text> That we should part ways in this manner... </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> Why, you. Are you mad? </text>
<text> My death would only be temporary. </text>
<text> Your savagery achieves nothing. </text>
<text> Agh! </text>
<text> Why, you. Are you mad? </text>
<text> Another moment of this, and no amount of grovelling will spare you. </text>
<text> You sadden me, my apprentice. </text>
<text> Ahh, how can this be... </text>
<text> ...every fallen child... must shine again... </text>
<text> For a time, I believed us kindred spirits. </text>
<text> My apprentice... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> If it isn't Nerijus. The Bloody Finger. </text>
<text> The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood. </text>
<text> Just joining the fray, Tarnished? </text>
<text> Well, you fought Nerijus and survived. That alone deserves commendation. </text>
<text> I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers. </text>
<text> Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. </text>
<text> If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them. </text>
<text> Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it. </text>
<text> Don't let your emotions stay your blade. </text>
<text> Well, you fought Nerijus and made good your escape. Fortune favours you, it seems. </text>
<text> Oh, one other thing... </text>
<text> There are other Tarnished, like me, who hunt the Bloody Fingers. </text>
<text> If a Bloody Finger threatens you, use this ring. </text>
<text> If fortune takes your side, a hunter will come to your aid. </text>
<text> Just joining the fray, Tarnished? </text>
<text> I am Yura, hunter of Bloody Fingers. </text>
<text> Have you ever faced a Bloody Finger? </text>
<text> They are Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. </text>
<text> If you stay the path, you will face this blight, sooner or later. </text>
<text> Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it. </text>
<text> Don't let your emotions stay your blade. </text>
<text> If fortune remains on your side, a hunter will come to your aid. </text>
<text> One last word of warning. </text>
<text> Stay clear of Agheel Lake. A great dragon roosts there. </text>
<text> Be on your way. </text>
<text> Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits. </text>
<text> Well, we meet again. </text>
<text> Beware. A great dragon roosts at Agheel Lake. </text>
<text> And it's as fearsome as it is majestic. </text>
<text> So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive... </text>
<text> stay clear of the lake. </text>
<text> Hmm, I gave you fair warning. </text>
<text> To stay clear of Agheel Lake, a known dragon roost. </text>
<text> Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late. </text>
<text> Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late. </text>
<text> Ah, we meet again. </text>
<text> To have fought Nerijus and lived, you must have seen your share of battle. </text>
<text> To have fought Nerijus and escaped, fortune must smile upon you indeed. </text>
<text> I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers. </text>
<text> Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. </text>
<text> If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them. </text>
<text> Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it. </text>
<text> Don't let your emotions stay your blade. </text>
<text> Ah, you must be the new Tarnished. </text>
<text> You'd do well to steer clear of Agheel Lake, fledgling. A dragon roosts there... </text>
<text> You bloody halfwit. </text>
<text> Picking a fight with a dragon? </text>
<text> Well, I can tell you want to see it through. </text>
<text> Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you. </text>
<text> Ah, we meet again. </text>
<text> I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers. </text>
<text> Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. </text>
<text> If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them. </text>
<text> Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it. </text>
<text> Don't let your emotions stay your blade. </text>
<text> Ah, you must be the new Tarnished. </text>
<text> And quite the fool, by the look of it. </text>
<text> Picking a fight with a dragon? Hah. </text>
<text> Well, I can tell you want to see it through. </text>
<text> Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you. </text>
<text> I can tell you want to see it through. </text>
<text> Fools will be fools. Fight all the dragons you like. </text>
<text> There you are. That was my first dragon hunt in quite some time. </text>
<text> Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times. </text>
<text> Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know. </text>
<text> That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion. </text>
<text> If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength, </text>
<text> then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast. </text>
<text> You must not forget, though. </text>
<text> Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity. </text>
<text> Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens. </text>
<text> Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment. </text>
<text> The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly. </text>
<text> It's no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous. </text>
<text> Beautiful work, felling that dragon. </text>
<text> And as such, there's something you might like to know. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Wretched worms, leave me be... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Ah, you must be the new Tarnished. </text>
<text> That was my first dragon hunt in quite a while. </text>
<text> Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times. </text>
<text> Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know. </text>
<text> The heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion. </text>
<text> If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength, </text>
<text> then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast. </text>
<text> Ah, you must be the new Tarnished. </text>
<text> Beautiful work, felling that dragon. </text>
<text> And as such, there's something you might like to know. </text>
<text> That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion. </text>
<text> If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength, </text>
<text> then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast. </text>
<text> Ah, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there. </text>
<text> That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him. </text>
<text> Here's a token of thanks. Please, take it. </text>
<text> I may not have much time. </text>
<text> I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger... </text>
<text> Yes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time. </text>
<text> She is the deadliest of all Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already. </text>
<text> But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight. </text>
<text> If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee. </text>
<text> There is no shame in self-preservation. </text>
<text> Be on your way. </text>
<text> Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits. </text>
<text> Eleonora, it seems I am no match for you. </text>
<text> But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see. </text>
<text> I've sliced the finger off. </text>
<text> Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer. </text>
<text> Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire... </text>
<text> Finally, we meet. </text>
<text> The Tarnished, who would be Lord. </text>
<text> Oh my, why the long face? </text>
<text> I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel. </text>
<text> Well, that is most unfortunate. For he is dead. </text>
<text> As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri. </text>
<text> I hope you can make your peace with that. </text>
<text> You are about to sacrifice something precious. </text>
<text> The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge. </text>
<text> Only so that you may be Lord. </text>
<text> What a horrible thing to ponder. </text>
<text> Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not. </text>
<text> But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon? </text>
<text> Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor. </text>
<text> Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead. </text>
<text> If you are prepared to show resolve, </text>
<text> and attain Lordship through righteous hardship, </text>
<text> then heed the words of I, Shabriri. </text>
<text> Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord. </text>
<text> Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital. </text>
<text> Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy. </text>
<text> If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling, </text>
<text> and the girl can be spared. </text>
<text> ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship. </text>
<text> The path of the Lord of Chaos. </text>
<text> Burn the Erdtree to the ground, </text>
<text> and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes. </text>
<text> Ahh, may chaos take the world! </text>
<text> May chaos take the world! </text>
<text> Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord. </text>
<text> Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital. </text>
<text> Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy. </text>
<text> Burn the Erdtree to the ground, </text>
<text> and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes. </text>
<text> Ahh, may chaos take the world! </text>
<text> May chaos take the world! </text>
<text> Ugh. </text>
<text> That will be quite enough. </text>
<text> What do you stand to gain by challenging me? </text>
<text> Too late for you, eh? </text>
<text> Well, if you've succumbed to cessblood... </text>
<text> it's better that I finish you here. </text>
<text> I had no choice. </text>
<text> Your death could have been much worse. </text>
<text> What a wretched fate. </text>
<text> Why did you turn foul... </text>
<text> I must not die... </text>
<text> until she is eradicated... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> What's this? </text>
<text> Well, this is peculiar. </text>
<text> Is this how you express contempt? </text>
<text> This, I did not expect. </text>
<text> But if you do not care for Lordship, </text>
<text> I'm afraid you are of no use. </text>
<text> How very unfortunate. </text>
<text> I did not take you for a fraud. </text>
<text> Shabriri is chaos incarnate. I cannot die. </text>
<text> Until we meet again, in another place or time. </text>
<text> Ahh, may chaos take the world! </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> There's no mistake, is there? </text>
<text> Death has left its mark once again. </text>
<text> I'm sorry, I cannot give you your proper rites... </text>
<text> But at least you did not join Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> Your soul will return to the Erdtree, in time. </text>
<text> Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit. </text>
<text> Ah, a Tarnished, are you? </text>
<text> I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot. </text>
<text> Heed my warning. </text>
<text> The village here has been touched by Death. </text>
<text> And worse yet, it is home to a mariner. </text>
<text> If you value your life, then go no further. </text>
<text> The village here has been touched by Death. </text>
<text> Turn back, while you still can. </text>
<text> Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh? </text>
<text> But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> How would you like to earn the strength of beasts? </text>
<text> If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot, </text>
<text> then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. </text>
<text> I have a matter of my own to attend to. </text>
<text> And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place. </text>
<text> What say you? </text>
<text> Very well. Show me your map. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway. </text>
<text> It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. </text>
<text> I have a matter of my own to attend to. </text>
<text> I spotted the mark of the centipede here in the village. </text>
<text> An ill-omened symbol that should not be. </text>
<text> Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> And must be eradicated. </text>
<text> What is it? Still milling about? </text>
<text> The map indicates where the gateway is hidden. </text>
<text> It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. </text>
<text> Well, all right, then. </text>
<text> No sense in forcing you. </text>
<text> What now? Had a change of heart? </text>
<text> Ah, a Tarnished, are you? </text>
<text> With a prowess for weeding Deathroot. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot. </text>
<text> How would you like to earn the strength of beasts? </text>
<text> If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot, </text>
<text> then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. </text>
<text> I have a matter of my own to attend to. </text>
<text> And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place. </text>
<text> Ha! Prince of Death, take a good long look! </text>
<text> See the wrath of the Golden Order! The Order's justice, writ in blood! </text>
<text> This is what's become of your precious witch! Naught but expired meat and bone! </text>
<text> This is a proper death, O Prince! </text>
<text> Look at this rotten whore. No more children can be got from this useless flesh! </text>
<text> Behold, your mother is dead! </text>
<text> Heh heh heh heh... </text>
<text> This is revenge, you witch! And you, you ghoul! This is the wrath of D! </text>
<text> Ah. Hello. </text>
<text> The rotten witch is dead. The Golden Order, unsullied. </text>
<text> Now I can look my brother Darian in the eye. </text>
<text> Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit. </text>
<text> Darian, now I have no regrets. </text>
<text> Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> Ah, aah... </text>
<text> D-da...ri... </text>
<text> Ngh...nnngh... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Ah, mm... </text>
<text> Y-You... </text>
<text> I require the sword...and raiment...of D... </text>
<text> I require the sword...of D... </text>
<text> For revenge... </text>
<text> For the wrath...of D... </text>
<text> Yeeesss... </text>
<text> YESSS! </text>
<text> Soon you will know, filthy witch... </text>
<text> Soon you will know... Vengeance for Darian. </text>
<text> The wrath of D... </text>
<text> I don't believe we've met. </text>
<text> I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot. </text>
<text> Heed my warning. </text>
<text> Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone. </text>
<text> All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number. </text>
<text> Unless you wish to lay down your life in vain. </text>
<text> Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone. </text>
<text> All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number. </text>
<text> Ah...we meet again. </text>
<text> I'm glad you took my warning to heart. </text>
<text> Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone. </text>
<text> All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number. </text>
<text> Well, well... </text>
<text> Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh? </text>
<text> But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot. </text>
<text> With a prowess for weeding Deathroot. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> How would you like to earn the strength of beasts? </text>
<text> If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot, </text>
<text> then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. </text>
<text> I have a matter of my own to attend to. </text>
<text> And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place. </text>
<text> What say you? </text>
<text> Very well. Show me your map. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway. </text>
<text> It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. </text>
<text> I have a matter of my own to attend to. </text>
<text> I've spotted the mark of the centipede. </text>
<text> An ill-omened symbol that should not be. </text>
<text> Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> And must be eradicated. </text>
<text> What is it? Still milling about? </text>
<text> The map indicates where the gateway is hidden. </text>
<text> It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. </text>
<text> Well, all right, then. </text>
<text> No sense in forcing you. </text>
<text> What's wrong? Got cold feet, have you? </text>
<text> You've met Gurranq, I take it? </text>
<text> Then owing to our duties shared, we are now comrades-in-arms. </text>
<text> I think you've earned this. </text>
<text> The power of the Golden Order, to aid the hunt of Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> Did you need something else? </text>
<text> Ah, hello there. What can I do for you? </text>
<text> Ah, hello. You've been busy weeding Deathroot, I take it. </text>
<text> I thank you, as your brother-in-arms. </text>
<text> So what can I do for you? </text>
<text> Ah, hello again. </text>
<text> You haven't gone to see Gurranq yet, have you? </text>
<text> Well, no rush. You do as you please. </text>
<text> Just as long as he doesn't starve to death, eh. </text>
<text> Go to Gurranq only if you feel the time is right. </text>
<text> Killing Those Who Live in Death and weeding their Deathroot... </text>
<text> Is a path not to be trod without ample resolve. </text>
<text> I serve the Golden Order. </text>
<text> That I might put this crooked land to rights. </text>
<text> Following only the guidance of the great Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Those Who Live in Death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> Their mere existence sullies the guidance of gold. Tainting its truth. </text>
<text> And so it is the vermin must be exterminated... Down to the very last. </text>
<text> Are you acquainted with a man named Rogier? </text>
<text> You know, the piteous fellow hiding away on the balcony? </text>
<text> He was a formidable spellblade, in times past. </text>
<text> Don't let his easy air deceive you. He was wise beyond his years, stout of heart and clear of mind. </text>
<text> No more though. </text>
<text> You see him now, ravaged by thorns, muttering and rambling... </text>
<text> Like he's half dead already. I can't stomach to watch. </text>
<text> Take well the lesson, friend. </text>
<text> That's how you end up, when seduced by Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> When grace is sullied, it rots people from the inside. Breaks them. </text>
<text> Well, what have we here? </text>
<text> How did you get your hands on that dagger? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Well. That hardly matters. </text>
<text> I know very well whose dagger it is. </text>
<text> Why don't I return it to them for you? </text>
<text> Good work, bringing this to me. </text>
<text> &lt;wince&gt; </text>
<text> Don't you dare. </text>
<text> Unless you want to die like a dog? </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit. </text>
<text> I swear, there's a blight spreading amongst the Tarnished. </text>
<text> How could this...happen...? </text>
<text> Forgive me, Devin... D-Devin... </text>
<text> Oof! </text>
<text> What's the meaning of this? </text>
<text> Has she bewitched you? </text>
<text> Very well. </text>
<text> Then you are a blight. </text>
<text> A defiler of the Golden Order, and murderer of my brother! </text>
<text> Die! Die! Die! </text>
<text> I'll grind your corpse into that vile wench's rotting remains. </text>
<text> A witch's eternal embrace, just as you wished! </text>
<text> You defiled cretin. My brother is now avenged! </text>
<text> How could this... </text>
<text> Forgive me, Darian... D-Darian... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Everyone's...been grafted. </text>
<text> Everyone who came with me. They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me. </text>
<text> Heh... </text>
<text> Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken. Even their heads...taken.<br>Taken and stuck to the spider. </text>
<text> Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid. </text>
<text> It's quite the lark, when you think about it. </text>
<text> You're all on your own, are you? </text>
<text> And heading to Stormveil Castle? </text>
<text> Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose. Oh, you've come to be one with the spider? </text>
<text> Well, that makes us two peas in a pod. </text>
<text> But I don't have your courage. </text>
<text> It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head. </text>
<text> I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared. </text>
<text> I'm nothing but a craven. </text>
<text> Oh, I know. </text>
<text> Can you take this little one along with you? </text>
<text> Can you take these little ones along with you? </text>
<text> The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself… </text>
<text> And the spirits look rather fondly upon you. </text>
<text> It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un. </text>
<text> They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns. </text>
<text> The poor things deserve someone braver than myself… </text>
<text> It was a pleasure to see you. </text>
<text> Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle? </text>
<text> Tell them I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough. </text>
<text> I'm finally getting the hang of this whole "pain" thing, you know. </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> What's this? </text>
<text> A keepsake? From my men? </text>
<text> Oh, goodness me… </text>
<text> I can't… </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> A pleasure to see you. </text>
<text> Did you give the little chrysalids the message? </text>
<text> That I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough. </text>
<text> They all...believed in me. </text>
<text> They all thought I'd make something of myself. Me! Who can't do anything... </text>
<text> I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> Perhaps I'll find my purpose there. </text>
<text> I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> Perhaps I'll find my purpose there. </text>
<text> Greetings. Nice to see you again. </text>
<text> My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner. </text>
<text> Isn't this place impressive, though? </text>
<text> The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots. </text>
<text> Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth. </text>
<text> I'm still looking for my own purpose. </text>
<text> You're telling me I possess some kind of gift? </text>
<text> I don't believe you. But... </text>
<text> If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first... </text>
<text> I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I? </text>
<text> I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me. </text>
<text> Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished... </text>
<text> But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So... </text>
<text> I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all. </text>
<text> Oh, and… </text>
<text> Please, allow to me to express my thanks. </text>
<text> For giving me that keepsake from my men. </text>
<text> It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn. </text>
<text> You have my gratitude. Please, take this. </text>
<text> A pleasure to meet you. </text>
<text> My name is Roderika. I'm a recent arrival. </text>
<text> Isn't this place impressive? </text>
<text> The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots. </text>
<text> Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth. </text>

<text> It's all a bit much for me, in truth. </text>
<text> I'm still looking for my own purpose. </text>
<text> A pleasure to see you. </text>
<text> Thank goodness you're safe. </text>
<text> I'm still looking for my own purpose. </text>
<text> It's not easy, by any means, but it's what I must do. </text>
<text> If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would be a surprise… </text>
<text> I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I? </text>
<text> I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me. </text>
<text> Good to see you again. Thank you very much! </text>
<text> I have you to thank, don't I? For persuading Master Hewg? </text>
<text> I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning. </text>
<text> I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish, </text>
<text> but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try. </text>
<text> And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted... </text>
<text> Well, I certainly must try. </text>
<text> Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance. </text>
<text> Greetings. </text>
<text> Are you here for spirit tuning? </text>
<text> I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late. </text>
<text> I can see how and why immortal essence exists as spirit under the Golden Order. </text>
<text> I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to... </text>
<text> Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner. </text>
<text> I'd like to ask you a small favour. </text>
<text> Can you take this little one along with you? </text>
<text> Can you take these little ones along with you? </text>
<text> They can't be summoned here. </text>
<text> But the spirits look rather fondly upon you. </text>
<text> It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un. </text>
<text> They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns. </text>
<text> I need to warn you about something. </text>
<text> A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable. </text>
<text> And I can hear, from all the way over there... </text>
<text> The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself... </text>
<text> A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony... </text>
<text> I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls... </text>
<text> Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen... </text>
<text> You should keep your distance. </text>
<text> I know you're strong, but please... </text>
<text> I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable... </text>
<text> The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself... </text>
<text> You should keep your distance. </text>
<text> I know you're strong, but please... </text>
<text> I can't hear them any more; the voices of the spirits cowering from the curse... </text>
<text> I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable. </text>
<text> I just pray nothing ill comes of this. </text>
<text> Be on your guard, I beg you. </text>
<text> He's back. The Dung Eater. Again. </text>
<text> I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse. </text>
<text> And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself. </text>
<text> But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now. </text>
<text> I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order. </text>
<text> The voices of the tormented spirits are silent again.. </text>
<text> But it isn't like last time. </text>
<text> I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement. </text>
<text> Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder? </text>
<text> Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground. </text>
<text> The Two Fingers went mad, and the Tarnished have all left. </text>
<text> Myself and Master Hewg are the only ones who remain. </text>
<text> Don't worry, I don't blame you. </text>
<text> I'll continue spirit tuning just the same as before. </text>
<text> Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave. </text>
<text> His roots are so knotted in this place. </text>
<text> He won't last much longer if he stays here... </text>
<text> His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now. </text>
<text> It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him. </text>
<text> I see. You're here for some spirit tuning? </text>
<text> Oh, is that right... </text>
<text> So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either. </text>
<text> You have my thanks, regardless. </text>
<text> I'll try and talk him round next time. </text>
<text> I know he was given this great entreaty; </text>
<text> To craft a weapon which could slay a god. Though I can't help but think of it as a curse. </text>
<text> A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika. </text>
<text> And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do... </text>
<text> Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to... </text>
<text> To think he'd forget who you were, as well. </text>
<text> I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg. </text>
<text> I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now. </text>
<text> But maybe it's better that we don't. </text>
<text> It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay. </text>
<text> I'll remain with Hewg. </text>
<text> He made me who I am today. </text>
<text> I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can. </text>
<text> Please, become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him. </text>
<text> So slay her, with the weapons he smithed. </text>
<text> Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all. </text>
<text> You're...giving it to me? </text>
<text> I've never had alcohol before... </text>
<text> I'm no longer a child. It's about time I took this step. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> You're willing to make me a chrysalid? </text>
<text> Ah, but I'm still a milksop craven... </text>
<text> I can't even govern myself to step beyond the bounds of this ward... </text>
<text> Please. You're only wasting your strength. </text>
<text> I know how you must feel. </text>
<text> But please, I'm not ready. </text>
<text> Or are you like me? You're so far out of your mind with fear... </text>
<text> You've divested yourself of all reason? </text>
<text> Please, stop. </text>
<text> Even if you persist, your fear will not abate. </text>
<text> Hello? Is anybody there? </text>
<text> Someone who might be interested in rescuing the great Kenneth Haight? </text>
<text> Servant to the true Order, and celebrated repudiator of the false! </text>
<text> O Erdtree! Grant me succour! </text>
<text> What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye? </text>
<text> My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me. </text>
<text> Oh I see. You wish to know the reward? </text>
<text> Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse. </text>
<text> The celebrations will be lavish indeed, upon the dawn of my fort's retrieval. </text>
<text> Hmph, yes, now allow me to furnish you with a little advice. </text>
<text> I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes. </text>
<text> That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of "grafting". </text>
<text> Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh. </text>
<text> First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle... </text>
<text> Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man. </text>
<text> Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse? </text>
<text> And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn't know it to look at him. </text>
<text> I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it. </text>
<text> What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye? </text>
<text> My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me. </text>
<text> Ah, you've come to lend me your aid, have you? </text>
<text> Well, that's very kind, but, um... </text>
<text> No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished. </text>
<text> Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order. </text>
<text> You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave. </text>
<text> Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you. </text>
<text> I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. </text>
<text> A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood! </text>

<text> A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one. </text>
<text> Fine work, I say, fine work, indeed. </text>
<text> I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you. </text>
<text> Now, this is your reward. </text>
<text> Go on, it is yours, for the keeping. </text>
<text> Ah-ha! I've been waiting for you with baited breath! </text>
<text> Did you manage to recapture my fort? </text>
<text> Oh excellent news, just wonderful. And the knight's dead to boot! </text>
<text> Well done my friend, well done indeed! </text>
<text> I knew I was right to trust you! </text>
<text> Now, here's your reward, as promised. </text>
<text> Go ahead, it's all yours. </text>
<text> Right then. Time for me to head to the fort. </text>
<text> I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans. </text>
<text> What's that look? You don't believe me? </text>
<text> Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible. </text>
<text> Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order. </text>
<text> Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it. </text>
<text> Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch. </text>
<text> Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask. </text>
<text> Would you like to enter my service? </text>
<text> I see bright things in your future, stout warrior. </text>
<text> Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order. </text>
<text> And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours. </text>
<text> What say you? A fine accord, is it not? </text>
<text> Very well. Very well, indeed. </text>
<text> I knew I saw something in you. </text>
<text> I shall await you at my fort. </text>
<text> We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think. </text>
<text> I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed. </text>
<text> Excuse me? </text>
<text> Such foolishness have I never seen! </text>
<text> Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice. </text>
<text> Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself. </text>
<text> Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort. </text>
<text> What is it? Have you put your misgivings to rest? </text>
<text> Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice. </text>
<text> Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself. </text>
<text> Oh don't fret, there's no hurry. </text>
<text> Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort. </text>
<text> Why... </text>
<text> Why the queen... Now all hope is... </text>
<text> (dies) </text>
<text> Ah, you, is it? </text>
<text> I suppose you must have seen it by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort? </text>
<text> Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler. </text>
<text> One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick. </text>
<text> But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. </text>
<text> I am sorry to have lifted your hopes... </text>
<text> But I haven't the authority to raise you to knighthood as things stand. </text>
<text> The great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology. </text>
<text> But now, I must begin my search post-haste. </text>
<text> For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. </text>
<text> I must begin my search post-haste. </text>
<text> For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. </text>
<text> Ah, nice to see you after so long. </text>
<text> Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good. </text>
<text> Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler. </text>
<text> Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage. </text>
<text> Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less. </text>
<text> For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards. </text>
<text> At which time I can fulfil my old promise. </text>
<text> By raising you to the glory of knighthood. </text>
<text> I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine. </text>

<text> Oof! </text>
<text> Goodness gracious! </text>
<text> Calm yourself, this instant! </text>
<text> Enough! This is madness! </text>
<text> Blast! You wretched Tarnished! </text>
<text> I am Kenneth Haight, and I have seen quite enough! </text>
<text> The madness leaves nothing untouched. </text>
<text> I fear for the integrity of the Order... </text>
<text> Where are my...men...? </text>
<text> O Erdtree, why have you forsaken me...? </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Greetings, great champion called by grace. </text>
<text> I am Fia. </text>
<text> Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly? </text>
<text> Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness. </text>
<text> Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion. </text>
<text> And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing. </text>
<text> Do you think it vulgar, perhaps? </text>
<text> Where I come from, it is a sacred act. </text>
<text> Ah, my thanks, great champion. </text>
<text> You are...very warm... </text>
<text> What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing. </text>
<text> Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid. </text>
<text> Come back to me, should you require another. </text>
<text> I will take you in my arms as often as you need. </text>
<text> I understand. </text>
<text> Your disdain is only natural. </text>
<text> But should you change your mind... </text>
<text> Come pay me another visit. </text>
<text> Oh, my dear... </text>
<text> Had a change of heart already? </text>
<text> I am pleased to see you again. </text>
<text> Would you like me to hold you, once more? </text>
<text> The blessing is still aflame in your breast, dear. </text>
<text> Would you like to be held, regardless? </text>
<text> Now, come closer... </text>
<text> You are so...very warm... </text>
<text> Then good day to you, my dear. </text>
<text> I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from. </text>
<text> After I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number of champions, </text>
<text> I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life. </text>
<text> To do so is the purpose of my being. </text>
<text> But before I could bear the noble into new life, </text>
<text> I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace. </text>
<text> Pray, be kind. </text>
<text> Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion. </text>
<text> So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes. </text>
<text> My dear... </text>
<text> Might I ask something of you? </text>
<text> Could you please find the owner of this dagger, and return it to them? </text>
<text> A certain person gave it to me, as a gift. </text>
<text> It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart. </text>
<text> So I would like for the original owner to have it back, if you wouldn't mind. </text>
<text> I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger I gave you, and return it to them. </text>
<text> It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart. </text>
<text> My dear... </text>
<text> Have you ever heard of black knifeprints? </text>
<text> Dear Rogier likes to talk of them when abed. </text>
<text> And the ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain. </text>
<text> The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act, </text>
<text> along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy. </text>
<text> These grand affairs are hardly my forté... </text>
<text> But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke... </text>

<text> I heard that you lent a hand to dear Rogier. </text>
<text> He seemed positively elated. </text>
<text> He must be possessed of great mental fortitude. </text>
<text> It anchors his will, and sustains him, despite his grievous wounds. </text>
<text> You truly are a champion. </text>
<text> To dear Rogier, and myself, too. </text>

<text> But It wouldn't be right to give this to him, stuck as he is in the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> Perhaps you could make use of it? </text>
<text> Finally, it is returned to its rightful place. </text>
<text> The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble. </text>
<text> And now, I must bid you goodbye as well. </text>
<text> Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> I am Fia, Deathbed Companion. </text>
<text> Hark, Roundtable. Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted. </text>
<text> We, who humbly live in Death... </text>
<text> Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord. </text>
<text> What right does anyone have to object? </text>
<text> Our Lord will rise. The Lord of the many, and the meek. </text>
<text> Ah...there you are. </text>
<text> I knew you would come. </text>
<text> What is it you intend? </text>
<text> To deny us, and our ways? </text>
<text> Like the dogmatic brutes of the Golden Order? </text>
<text> I see. Then you must kill me. </text>
<text> For I am the companion of Godwyn, Prince of Death. </text>
<text> I wished to be a mother to Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> So it is, that any loathing, any hatred that overshadows them... </text>
<text> I must bear, as a matter of duty, with my own flesh. </text>
<text> Go on, kill me. </text>
<text> You deny us, do you not? </text>
<text> Because we deign to live in Death, and wish our Lord to rise to glory. </text>
<text> You are an odd one. </text>
<text> I am the guardian of Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> They call me a foul and rotten witch. </text>
<text> Yet you still wish to be held by me? </text>
<text> I will soon lay with Godwyn. </text>
<text> And it will surely stir within me. </text>
<text> the new life of the golden prince, and first Dead of the demigods, </text>
<text> as the rune of Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> Please, do one thing for me. </text>
<text> Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne. </text>
<text> Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> By becoming our Elden Lord. </text>
<text> I will soon lay with Godwyn. </text>
<text> To conceive my child, the rune. </text>
<text> Brandish my rune, and take for yourself the throne. </text>
<text> Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death. </text>
<text> By becoming our Elden Lord. </text>
<text> This is goodbye, my dear. </text>
<text> But I am satisfied. </text>
<text> I choose to lie with Godwyn of my own will. Not the remains of one chosen for me. </text>
<text> And I will bear a child. </text>
<text> Who will inherit your warmth, too. </text>
<text> What greater blessing could there be, but to be born a Deathbed Companion? </text>

<text> Have you ever seen a hallowbrand? </text>
<text> When the first of the demigods died, his flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede. </text>
<text> Godwyn's hallowbrand has since been recovered at the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> But there is another hallowbrand out there somewhere. </text>
<text> And I must find it. </text>
<text> Before the time comes we receive our Lord. </text>
<text> When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh. </text>
<text> But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede. </text>
<text> And I must find it. </text>
<text> Before the time comes we receive our Lord. </text>
<text> My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed. </text>
<text> Will you still let me hold you, even then? </text>
<text> When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh. </text>
<text> But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede. </text>
<text> And I must find it. </text>

<text> ...! </text>
<text> This...is the other hallowbrand. </text>
<text> How did you... </text>
<text> Oh, my utmost thanks. </text>
<text> With this, Godwyn can take his rightful place as First of the Dead. </text>
<text> And claim a second, illustrious life. </text>
<text> You are my-- our true champion. </text>
<text> And though I can't be of any use to you... </text>
<text> Can I hold you tight, if only for a moment? </text>
<text> Godwyn... </text>
<text> Is that you, dear? </text>
<text> Will your kind never stop? </text>
<text> Ravaging...the weak? </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Have you ever felt the curse, with your whole being? </text>
<text> The pox upon life itself, feared and despised by all. The reviled blessing. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Apparently not. </text>
<text> You are but a lamb. A stranger to defilement. Ignorant of your own ignorance. </text>
<text> You no longer interest me. </text>
<text> I've been long without peace. Don't spoil my quietude. </text>
<text> I asked you not to disturb me. </text>
<text> Be thankful of the Hold's serenity. </text>
<text> It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay. </text>
<text> No, wait. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> You have felt the curse. </text>
<text> I can smell it on you. The pox, yet tender. </text>
<text> Apparently my seedbed is ripe and waiting. </text>
<text> Twas a brief respite, I must say. </text>
<text> Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh. </text>
<text> Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital. </text>
<text> I can kill you, and defile your corpse. </text>
<text> Then the pox will truly be your own. </text>
<text> Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh. </text>
<text> Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital. </text>
<text> I can kill you, and defile your corpse. </text>
<text> Then the pox will truly be your own. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Let me out! Let me out of here! </text>
<text> Must eat more! Defile more! </text>
<text> Everything that matters to you! </text>
<text> For generations to come! </text>
<text> I am the Dung Eater! </text>
<text> A scourge upon the living! </text>
<text> Who are you? </text>
<text> I've been here long enough. </text>
<text> I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care. </text>
<text> Just to be sure. That when they're reborn… </text>
<text> They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come… </text>
<text> I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care. </text>
<text> Just to be sure. That when they're reborn… </text>
<text> They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come… </text>
<text> I am the Dung Eater. </text>
<text> A scourge upon the living. </text>
<text> I must eat more. Defile more... </text>
<text> Let me out. Let me out of here. </text>
<text> I will kill you, and defile your corpse. </text>
<text> Then the pox will truly be your own. </text>
<text> I'll give you a good blessing. </text>
<text> You'll be nourishment for the pox. </text>
<text> There you are. </text>
<text> You warded off my blessing. </text>
<text> Despite the curse stirring within you. </text>
<text> No one has succeeded in that before. </text>
<text> How? I thought. Then it hit me. </text>
<text> That you are, in fact, me. And I...am the Dung Eater. </text>
<text> It is my flesh that must receive the blessing. </text>
<text> Give me your blessing. </text>
<text> Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse. </text>
<text> Again and again. Until it is done. </text>
<text> Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself. </text>
<text> Countless, I have killed. And countless, I have defiled. </text>
<text> And soon the fruits will be borne. </text>
<text> Hundreds will be reborn cursed, and they'll bear thousands of cursed children, who'll bear tens of thousands more. </text>
<text> A few of those will be born just like me, and they'll kill, and defile, and bless in my stead! </text>
<text> The rotten fools. My fate was the grandest, most brilliant of them all! </text>
<text> My corporeal flesh lies in the sewer gaol beneath the Capital. </text>
<text> Give it your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse. </text>
<text> Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself. </text>
<text> Uur...urgh... </text>
<text> A curse... A curse upon them all. </text>
<text> They'll be born cursed, all of them. </text>
<text> Along with their children, and their children's children, heh, for all time to come… </text>
<text> Uur...urgh... </text>
<text> Curse you, Golden Order. </text>
<text> One day, you'll get what's coming. </text>
<text> Ah...argh... </text>
<text> No... I am... the Dung Eater... </text>
<text> I am... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Bless you! </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Oh, this is a rare occasion. </text>
<text> I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable. </text>
<text> Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome. </text>
<text> It is safe here. You may let down your guard. </text>
<text> Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. </text>
<text> You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. </text>
<text> A house guest, yet to earn their keep. </text>
<text> Remember your place, newcomer. </text>
<text> There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure. </text>
<text> What do you need? I have little time to spare. </text>
<text> Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here? </text>
<text> Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you. </text>
<text> Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord. </text>
<text> If those words held any meaning to you... </text>
<text> Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune. </text>
<text> Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open. </text>
<text> And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers. </text>
<text> Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome. </text>
<text> As a true member of the Roundtable. </text>
<text> I have high hopes for you. </text>
<text> I'm sick and tired of them. </text>
<text> These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain... </text>
<text> We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to. </text>
<text> If you haven't anything to say, I would prefer you didn't pester me for attention. </text>
<text> Try not to make a spectacle of yourself either. Or are you as irredeemably foolish as you appear? </text>
<text> You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not? </text>
<text> Then just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable. </text>
<text> I am known as Gideon Ofnir. </text>
<text> As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, </text>
<text> I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing. </text>
<text> You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant. </text>
<text> You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh? </text>
<text> Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge. </text>
<text> The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers. </text>
<text> We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated. </text>
<text> Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. </text>
<text> General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir. </text>
<text> Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell. </text>
<text> And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy. </text>
<text> ...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you? </text>
<text> So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. </text>
<text> Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power. </text>
<text> His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest. </text>
<text> ...but I suspect you know that well enough already. </text>
<text> General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. </text>
<text> He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. </text>
<text> And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat. </text>
<text> I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire. </text>
<text> And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid. </text>
<text> Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore... </text>
<text> Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir. </text>
<text> He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour. </text>
<text> The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering. </text>
<text> Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven. </text>
<text> Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. </text>
<text> It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. </text>
<text> But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. </text>
<text> Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait. </text>
<text> The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. </text>
<text> Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. </text>
<text> But Rennala herself is no demigod. </text>
<text> She is merely the recipient of an amber egg, given to her by Radagon, </text>
<text> Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort. </text>
<text> The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her. </text>
<text> There are four more demigods yet to be located. </text>
<text> Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. </text>
<text> His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman. </text>
<text> Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala. </text>
<text> And the one only known as the Lord of Blood. </text>
<text> Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, </text>
<text> so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers. </text>
<text> If you should learn anything of these matters, </text>
<text> I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me. </text>
<text> We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> As such, I hope we are compelled to work together. </text>
<text> I'll trade your findings for something rather special. </text>
<text> Ah, you. What is it? </text>
<text> Well...what is it now? </text>
<text> Well. I see you've found another Great Rune. </text>
<text> Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed. </text>
<text> Make the journey. </text>
<text> To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer. </text>
<text> You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace. </text>
<text> Journey to the capital Leyndell, to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer. </text>
<text> You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. </text>
<text> He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. </text>
<text> And by my reckoning Radahn remains there, even now. </text>
<text> Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore... </text>
<text> Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. </text>
<text> It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. </text>
<text> But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. </text>
<text> Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. </text>
<text> Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. </text>
<text> And her Great Rune dwells within the egg she so dearly clutches. </text>
<text> You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not? </text>
<text> Then I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable. </text>
<text> I am known as Gideon Ofnir. </text>
<text> As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, </text>
<text> I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing. </text>
<text> You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant. </text>
<text> I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli. </text>
<text> She is my daughter. </text>
<text> I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace. </text>
<text> Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes. </text>
<text> So I put her to work. </text>
<text> Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you. </text>
<text> Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle. </text>
<text> Ahh, you've already heard? </text>
<text> Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions. </text>
<text> So I had no further use for her. </text>
<text> Honestly, what's a man to do. </text>
<text> A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly. </text>
<text> I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants. </text>
<text> A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished. </text>
<text> Is that potion what I think it is? </text>
<text> Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again. </text>
<text> Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must. </text>
<text> The Roundtable has no code to speak of. </text>
<text> But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer? </text>
<text> Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard? </text>
<text> Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself. </text>
<text> You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away. </text>
<text> Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned. </text>
<text> Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing. </text>
<text> His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold. </text>
<text> Well, I won't force you. </text>
<text> But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste. </text>
<text> She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential. </text>
<text> Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet. </text>
<text> I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet. </text>
<text> Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you. </text>
<text> Sorry. For the time you had to waste. </text>
<text> Well, I won't force you. </text>
<text> If you want to do that dolly botherer's bidding, that's up to you. </text>
<text> Not that I could fathom why you'd want to... </text>
<text> Oh, my apologies for that nasty business. </text>
<text> Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems. </text>
<text> As his master, I'd like to express my regret. </text>
<text> But now, Ensha is slain and gone. </text>
<text> Finished, forever more. </text>
<text> Ah, yes, by way of apology, </text>
<text> allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. </text>
<text> Find the Albinauric woman. </text>
<text> She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia, </text>
<text> She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure. </text>
<text> together with her great wolf. </text>
<text> Find the Albinauric woman. </text>
<text> She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia, </text>
<text> She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure. </text>
<text> together with her great wolf. </text>
<text> Ah, yes, by way of apology, </text>
<text> allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. </text>
<text> Find the village of the Albinaurics. </text>
<text> It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands. </text>
<text> And some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere. </text>
<text> Find the village of the Albinaurics. </text>
<text> It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands. </text>
<text> Some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere. </text>
<text> Ahh, I know already. You're after it too, aren't you. </text>
<text> To pass the impenetrable thorns, you seek the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants. </text>
<text> Then you need to reach the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region. </text>
<text> Hah, no need to pay me for that gift. </text>
<text> All my knowledge is for the sake of guidance. </text>
<text> That a Tarnished might stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> It doesn't have to be me, my fellow. </text>
<text> If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants. </text>
<text> You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region. </text>
<text> I marked your map with its location. </text>
<text> Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin". </text>
<text> The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago. </text>
<text> Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion. </text>
<text> I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone. </text>
<text> You've made more of yourself than Ensha has... </text>
<text> Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands. </text>
<text> I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead? </text>
<text> Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath. </text>
<text> Ahh, so the secret medallions led you to the land of the Haligtree? </text>
<text> I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill. </text>
<text> Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely. </text>
<text> But...with the Haligtree as it is... </text>
<text> I suppose Miquella must already be... </text>
<text> Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there. </text>
<text> The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward: </text>
<text> A hidden treasure, known only to me. </text>
<text> A secret rite known only to me. </text>
<text> You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant. </text>
<text> And it is a wondrous thing indeed. </text>
<text> So. The Haligtree, now but a husk... </text>
<text> I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree, </text>
<text> but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form. </text>
<text> Indeed, it seems those words held weight. </text>
<text> How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story... </text>
<text> Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified... </text>
<text> Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh. </text>
<text> A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers. </text>
<text> Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable. </text>
<text> But perhaps it's worth looking into... </text>
<text> If what I've heard is right, then maybe... </text>
<text> Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all! </text>
<text> That is some fine intelligence indeed! </text>
<text> With it, the final clue has been brought into the light. </text>
<text> One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together. </text>
<text> As promised, allow me to impart to you </text>
<text> the last of the hidden treasures known only to me. </text>
<text> the last of the secret rites known only to me. </text>
<text> a thing most wondrous, known only to me. </text>
<text> Well, I wonder what comes next... </text>
<text> If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well. </text>
<text> But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it. </text>
<text> Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me... </text>
<text> You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you? </text>
<text> Then the Roundtable is soon to follow. </text>
<text> Ah, no need to fret about that. </text>
<text> The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord. </text>
<text> And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen, </text>
<text> then the Roundtable must go, as well. </text>
<text> I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time. </text>
<text> I must learn all that can be taken from this place, </text>
<text> and sear it into my memory. </text>
<text> How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less? </text>
<text> The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete. </text>
<text> Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing. </text>
<text> Perhaps the same could be said of guidance. </text>
<text> Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished? </text>
<text> What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord? </text>
<text> Ahh, I knew you'd come. </text>
<text> To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> What a sad state of affairs. </text>
<text> I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne. </text>
<text> Queen Marika has high hopes for us. </text>
<text> That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity. </text>
<text> You think I don't know what that is? </text>
<text> I have no secrets for you to salaciously gawp at. </text>
<text> You think too little of Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing. </text>
<text> My fellow, you've fought well, until now. </text>
<text> I know...in my bones... </text>
<text> A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you. </text>
<text> A man cannot kill a god... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Knowledge above all! </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Ah, nice to meet you. </text>
<text> The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed. </text>
<text> I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle. </text>
<text> When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is. </text>
<text> But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle? </text>
<text> This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting. </text>
<text> Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind... </text>
<text> I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you? </text>
<text> You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace. </text>
<text> Well, enjoy it while you can. </text>
<text> I'm Tarnished, like you. </text>
<text> But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time. </text>
<text> Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between. </text>
<text> I'm privy to a few magical battle arts. </text>
<text> Would you care to learn one? </text>
<text> As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please. </text>
<text> Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we? </text>
<text> Oh hello there, good to see you safe. </text>
<text> Stopping by to learn a battle art or two? </text>
<text> The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family. </text>
<text> They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle. </text>
<text> In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told. </text>
<text> Fascinating, isn't it? </text>
<text> That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past. </text>
<text> With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair, </text>
<text> such adaptability is more important now than ever. </text>
<text> Of course. I understand. </text>
<text> Why place trust in a perfect stranger? </text>
<text> Be safe, then, stranger. </text>
<text> Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same. </text>
<text> Oh? Something bothering you? </text>
<text> Or are you just trying to pass the time? </text>
<text> I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle. </text>
<text> Ah, we meet again after all. </text>
<text> I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see. </text>
<text> So. What do you need? </text>
<text> Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune. </text>
<text> Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we. </text>
<text> Well done, friend. </text>
<text> Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it. </text>
<text> As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me. </text>
<text> No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore. </text>
<text> The misshapen corpse under Stormveil? </text>
<text> That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known. </text>
<text> It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. </text>
<text> And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. </text>
<text> That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. </text>
<text> And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering. </text>
<text> I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot. </text>
<text> The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights, </text>
<text> You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm? </text>
<text> This...is a black knifeprint! </text>
<text> I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this! </text>
<text> You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes? </text>
<text> They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City. </text>
<text> A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye. </text>
<text> The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite. </text>
<text> Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time. </text>
<text> I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets. </text>
<text> Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death. </text>
<text> Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint... </text>
<text> Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see. </text>
<text> Oh, still need something? </text>
<text> Always good to see you safe. </text>
<text> So. What do you need? </text>
<text> Ah, so you've met D. </text>
<text> D is an old friend. </text>
<text> We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death. </text>
<text> But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross. </text>
<text> Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends. </text>
<text> Pleased to meet you. </text>
<text> The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade. </text>
<text> But now I'm in this sorry state. </text>
<text> I had a little mishap, and now I can't move. </text>
<text> As you might guess, it's far from ideal... </text>
<text> Ah, I know. </text>
<text> I'm privy to a few magical battle arts. </text>
<text> Would you care to learn one? </text>
<text> Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know. </text>
<text> A little conversation goes a long way. </text>
<text> Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you. </text>
<text> My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks. </text>
<text> Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives. </text>
<text> Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla. </text>
<text> Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. </text>
<text> Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint. </text>
<text> Truly, you have my thanks. </text>
<text> But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you. </text>
<text> If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, </text>
<text> then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. </text>
<text> I would like you to procure it for me. </text>
<text> And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long. </text>
<text> Don't fret, it is entirely in accordance with the guidance of grace. </text>
<text> If you seek to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, </text>
<text> The answers you find will surely bolster your chances. </text>
<text> I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts. </text>
<text> There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends. </text>
<text> There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years </text>
<text> Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once. </text>
<text> But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born... </text>
<text> If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, </text>
<text> then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. </text>
<text> Would you be willing to procure it for me? </text>
<text> She may have returned to the manor that is her home. </text>
<text> The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> I'm afraid there's something I must tell you. </text>
<text> Do you know of Those Who Live in Death? </text>
<text> The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order. </text>
<text> By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged. </text>
<text> But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them. </text>
<text> You may find this peculiar, </text>
<text> but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives. </text>
<text> These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order. </text>
<text> Yes, indeed. </text>
<text> If D knew what drives me now, </text>
<text> he would surely boil over with rage. </text>
<text> Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity. </text>
<text> But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass. </text>
<text> I can tell a good lie when I need to. </text>
<text> And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now... </text>
<text> I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary... </text>
<text> Oh? Forgot something, did you? </text>
<text> Alright there. Good to see you safe. </text>
<text> I see... </text>
<text> When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too. </text>
<text> You know, not everyone would trust such a tale... </text>
<text> But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess... </text>
<text> Then perhaps it's true after all. </text>
<text> Hmm. </text>
<text> Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but... </text>
<text> How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals? </text>
<text> Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course. </text>
<text> The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest. </text>
<text> And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly. </text>
<text> I know you've got what it takes. </text>
<text> Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. </text>
<text> Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda? </text>
<text> While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly. </text>
<text> And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark. </text>
<text> I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger. </text>
<text> But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact. </text>
<text> Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. </text>
<text> D was telling me. </text>
<text> That he discovered the mark of the centipede. </text>
<text> The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark. </text>
<text> As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature, </text>
<text> then we may be able to form an alliance. </text>
<text> If only I could speak to them in person. </text>
<text> And if they were like you, all the better. </text>
<text> Hmm. Maybe I should tell you. </text>
<text> Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice... </text>
<text> Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber. </text>
<text> And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow. </text>
<text> So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand. </text>
<text> Since you're so scary and all. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;moans and stutters&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;struggles to say a word, but mostly fails&gt; </text>
<text> Off..er her c-curse...m-mark </text>

<text> A…fu-full...circle </text>
<text> F-forms…a…r...rune... </text>
<text> (Dies) </text>
<text> For me, really? </text>
<text> Why thank you very much. </text>
<text> I'll try anything once. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> ...No thank you. </text>
<text> I don't need your pity. </text>
<text> Ah... </text>
<text> Sorry. You were only trying to be nice. </text>
<text> It would be my pleasure to take it. My thanks. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> Oof! </text>
<text> I fear you are mistaken. </text>
<text> I am no foe of yours, far from it. </text>
<text> This is rather unfortunate. </text>
<text> I don't normally find myself cornered like a rat. </text>
<text> But I have my ways... </text>
<text> No need to grandstand; you're not even on stage. </text>
<text> Well, this is unfortunate. </text>
<text> Couldn't change a thing... </text>
<text> Agh! </text>
<text> I fear you are mistaken. </text>
<text> I am no foe of yours, far from it. </text>
<text> If you think I am helpless, </text>
<text> you are quite mistaken, I'm afraid. </text>
<text> If this doesn't cause you shame, nothing will. </text>
<text> Well, this is unfortunate. </text>
<text> Couldn't change a thing... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>

<text> C-curse...m-mark </text>
<text> Fi…a's… fi…a's… </text>
<text> T-to... G-god... wyn </text>
<text> Not seen you before. </text>
<text> Name's Bernahl. Tarnished, just like you. </text>
<text> Let me ask you something. </text>
<text> Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight? </text>
<text> Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm, </text>
<text> despite the collapse of the Golden Order? </text>
<text> Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through. </text>
<text> Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever. </text>
<text> Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? </text>
<text> All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. </text>
<text> Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you. </text>
<text> Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy. </text>
<text> Ah, hello. Glad to see you safe. </text>
<text> Here to learn a battle art or two? </text>
<text> There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover. </text>
<text> Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died. </text>
<text> A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance. </text>
<text> That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat. </text>
<text> It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself. </text>
<text> Honest to a fault, I see. </text>
<text> Such thoughts won't behove you, as a Tarnished. </text>
<text> But there's nothing wrong with that. </text>
<text> Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? </text>
<text> All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. </text>
<text> Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good Tarnished, like you. </text>
<text> Not floating your boat, eh? </text>
<text> Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day. </text>
<text> There you are. Decided to bear the torch of my battle arts? </text>
<text> Well, until we meet again. </text>
<text> You... </text>
<text> What in heaven's name are you doing here? </text>
<text> The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind. </text>
<text> I hope you understand the weight of my words. </text>
<text> Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. </text>
<text> I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue. </text>
<text> Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder. </text>
<text> But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death. </text>
<text> Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. </text>
<text> This blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death. </text>
<text> Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. </text>
<text> So. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt. </text>
<text> Then I shall introduce myself once more. </text>
<text> Bernahl, a recusant, just like you. </text>
<text> Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter. </text>
<text> Why not add some to your repertoire? </text>
<text> Oh, not had your fill, eh? </text>
<text> You're still alive, I see. </text>
<text> Why not learn another battle art, see if we can't keep it that way. </text>
<text> You've come to understand, now, eh? </text>
<text> To take power and make it his own, </text>
<text> The recusant must hunt his own kind. </text>
<text> To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging, </text>
<text> We recusants must become the most wretched of predators. </text>
<text> All you can do is laugh. </text>
<text> Look at you. A recusant through and through. </text>
<text> I knew you had it in you. </text>
<text> Take this. </text>
<text> A special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle. </text>
<text> Ah, I had hoped you'd soon return. </text>
<text> I have the reward from Lady Tanith. </text>
<text> Take it. It's yours, by right. </text>
<text> Let us tread the path of the recusant together. </text>
<text> Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us. </text>
<text> So. You killed Rykard? </text>
<text> I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code. </text>
<text> Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh. </text>
<text> But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more. </text>
<text> Though we may yet fulfil an old promise. </text>
<text> We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs. </text>
<text> And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree. </text>
<text> O Greater Will, hear my voice. </text>
<text> I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade. </text>
<text> We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning. </text>
<text> Who are you? </text>
<text> And what in heaven's name are you doing here? </text>
<text> The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind. </text>
<text> I hope you understand the weight of my words. </text>
<text> Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. </text>
<text> You have harboured doubts from the very beginning. </text>
<text> Perhaps this day was always lurking on the horizon. </text>
<text> But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death. </text>
<text> Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. </text>
<text> Then you must leave immediately. </text>
<text> Those with weak stomachs have no place here. </text>
<text> I thought I told you to leave. </text>
<text> Or do you claim to understand? </text>
<text> What it means to be a recusant, renouncing grace and hunting down one's own. </text>
<text> Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. </text>
<text> But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death. </text>
<text> Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. </text>
<text> Oh, a brew, is it? </text>
<text> Thanking me for the battle arts? </text>
<text> You're one of the good ones. Thank you. </text>
<text> Oh, a brew, is it? </text>
<text> Fitting, I suppose. </text>
<text> For a recusant already drunk on blasphemy. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> Agh! </text>
<text> What's wrong with you? </text>
<text> I won't say it twice. Stop this. </text>
<text> I suppose I have no choice, then. </text>
<text> Is this what grace would have of us? </text>
<text> Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished. </text>
<text> You are an enigma, to be certain. </text>
<text> The Volcano Manor awaits you. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> You're Tarnished, aren't you? </text>
<text> I welcome you, to the Church of Vows. </text>
<text> I am Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber. </text>
<text> My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs. </text>
<text> Do you know the origin of this place? </text>
<text> How it came to be known as the Church of Vows? </text>
<text> Well, that is a shame. But who can blame you? </text>
<text> The Shattering has caused us - all of us - to lose sight of something very dear. </text>
<text> It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined. </text>
<text> By the matrimonial bond between red-haired Radagon and Rennala of the Full Moon. </text>
<text> And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses. </text>
<text> The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> Oh, was there something you needed? </text>
<text> You are free to show yourself around. </text>
<text> I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be... </text>
<text> If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you. </text>
<text> Unless perhaps you are in search of instruction? </text>
<text> In which case, I will share all that I know. </text>
<text> Whether it be sorcery or incantations, learning should not fetter you to one side or the other. </text>
<text> This is, after all, a church celebrating the union of two such opposed practitioners. </text>
<text> Is there something else? </text>
<text> Greetings. Do you need anything? </text>
<text> Do you possess any celestial dew? </text>
<text> Then I would like to share my knowledge with you. </text>
<text> Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows. </text>
<text> Radagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew, </text>
<text> repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala. </text>
<text> The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven. </text>
<text> This miracle blesses the church to this day. </text>
<text> And so, you need only follow Radagon's example, </text>
<text> to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony. </text>
<text> My faith does not waver. </text>
<text> The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world. </text>
<text> And this time, its bounty will not be squandered. </text>
<text> If you would be Elden Lord, Tarnished, </text>
<text> I hope that you, too, will share my faith. </text>
<text> Are you taking the sword with you? </text>
<text> Oh, fear not, I don't wish to chide you. </text>
<text> Clearly, you are no conniving thief. </text>
<text> The sword is telling us something, no doubt. </text>
<text> Rather than collect dust in the shadows underground, </text>
<text> it yearns to be wielded by your rightful hand. </text>
<text> Ah, now I recall. </text>
<text> As the priest of the Church of Vows, I undo the sword's seal, and bequeath it unto you. </text>
<text> May you hold it high and proud. </text>
<text> Are you quite finished? </text>
<text> Take this opportunity to learn to master your emotions. </text>
<text> Worry not, I take no offence. But others are not always so forgiving. </text>
<text> Some take to anger, others sorrow... Bonds are fragile things, wont to break under strain. </text>
<text> And once they're broken, everything is lost, with naught to gain. </text>
<text> Are you quite finished? </text>
<text> I suppose my ample frame must have given you quite the fright. </text>
<text> Allow me to introduce myself. Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber. </text>
<text> My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs. </text>
<text> Do you know the origin of this place? </text>
<text> How it came to be known as the Church of Vows? </text>
<text> Are you quite finished, now? </text>
<text> To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew. </text>
<text> Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights. </text>
<text> Ah, I see you have undergone absolution, the miracle that blossoms from these grounds. </text>
<text> Good. As such, the bond you may have strained or severed... </text>
<text> Has been restored, to its rightful state of harmony. </text>
<text> Be mindful, not to take for granted... </text>
<text> the serenity restored by this miracle. </text>
<text> And take care. Never to break a bond again. </text>
<text> You wish to know more of Lord Radagon? </text>
<text> Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks. </text>
<text> He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle. </text>
<text> He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen. </text>
<text> However. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, </text>
<text> Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort. </text>
<text> Taking the title...of second Elden Lord. </text>
<text> The mystery endures, to this day... </text>
<text> As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside... </text>
<text> And moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord... </text>
<text> You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret... </text>
<text> A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature. </text>
<text> When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet. </text>
<text> And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too. </text>
<text> You wish to know more of Lady Rennala? </text>
<text> She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch. </text>
<text> Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her. </text>
<text> And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library. </text>
<text> In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her. </text>
<text> Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite; </text>
<text> the grim art of reincarnation. </text>
<text> You would do well to remember... </text>
<text> Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire. </text>
<text> Why, this is nectar, is it not? </text>
<text> And you're giving it to me? </text>
<text> Oh, wonderful, just wonderful. </text>
<text> Truth be told, I'm rather fond of the stuff. </text>
<text> I'll happily take it off your hands! </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> Oh, what have we here? </text>
<text> Very well, let us both learn together. </text>
<text> Heresy is not native to the world; it is but a contrivance. </text>
<text> All things can be conjoined. </text>
<text> Mngh! </text>
<text> Stop it, please. </text>
<text> My flesh is akin to stone. </text>
<text> I cannot be wounded. I cannot die. </text>
<text> But nor will I cause any harm unto you. </text>
<text> Cease your futile efforts. </text>
<text> Well, aren't we determined. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Aaa...aaargh! </text>
<text> What are you lookin' at? </text>
<text> You trying to start something, mate? </text>
<text> Oh, that necklace what you're after, is it? </text>
<text> Hmm, well… </text>
<text> Show me what it's worth to you, </text>
<text> and I'll consider parting ways with it. </text>
<text> I'm not in love with it or nothing. </text>
<text> You're a shrewd one, chief. </text>
<text> First, you hand me the runes. And don't try nothin', neither. </text>
<text> Hmm... </text>
<text> Alright. Take it. </text>
<text> Thing's no damn use to anyone, anyway. </text>
<text> Your bloody idea, mate. Don't come crying to me later. </text>
<text> Oh piss off, what is it now? </text>
<text> Oh, I see. You want some of me prawn? </text>
<text> Freshly cooked, it is. </text>
<text> Alright then. It's yours, if you can meet me price. </text>
<text> I could be persuaded to sell you some other bits too, if you've got the runes. </text>
<text> What the hell is wrong with you. </text>
<text> You trying to start something? </text>
<text> Piss off. Before I crack you in 'alf. </text>
<text> This bloody swine... </text>
<text> Decided to play ball now, 'ave you? </text>
<text> You'll be wantin' the necklace, then? </text>
<text> Think you're bloody clever, do ya? </text>
<text> Then how about you piss off? </text>
<text> fore I crack you in 'alf. </text>
<text> Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry. </text>
<text> Alright mate. Want some more prawn, do ya? </text>
<text> Alright mate. Still 'ungry, are ya? </text>
<text> Never met someone with a taste for prawn I couldn't trust. </text>
<text> We'd make good mates, I reckon. </text>
<text> I'll be seeing ya. </text>
<text> Oh, so you met the girl, did ya? </text>
<text> Alright, well, sod the particulars of the matter, </text>
<text> But it ain't my fault she's stupid enough to get duped, is it. </text>
<text> Anyway, she ain't all right, that one. </text>
<text> Lucky she ain't died on the bloody roadside, I reckon. </text>
<text> You're Tarnished too, ain'tcha? </text>
<text> Can you see it then? The guidance of grace, I mean. </text>
<text> I can't see it at all no more. </text>
<text> Makes no bloody sense anyway, why some no-name shithead like me should get called to the Lands Between. </text>
<text> Cruel bloody joke, you ask me. </text>
<text> Maybe something went tits up with it. Maybe... it's been broke for a good long time. </text>
<text> The Erdtree, I'm sayin'. </text>
<text> You what? Sod the particulars, mate. </text>
<text> Ain't my fault people are so bloody stupid, is it? </text>
<text> Don't like that it's stolen? Don't sodding buy it.. </text>
<text> What are you lookin' at? </text>
<text> Oh...you again, is it. </text>
<text> Perfect bloody timing, actually. </text>
<text> I got crab, cooked up fresh. </text>
<text> Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry. </text>
<text> Alright mate. Want some more crab, do ya? </text>
<text> Alright mate. Still 'ungry, are ya? </text>
<text> Never met someone with a taste for crab I couldn't trust. </text>
<text> We've got a real thing here, eh, and it's only gettin' better. </text>
<text> Mate, there's somethin' I should probably tell ya. </text>
<text> You 'eard of the Dung Eater? </text>
<text> E's a madman, 'as it out for everyone. Curses 'em. Goes 'round in this rank armour, an' all. </text>
<text> You see 'im though, stay well away. </text>
<text> I was in the same gaol as him, once, so I know first 'and. </text>
<text> E's a god-forsaken monster. Not just some petty thug like me. </text>
<text> E's a killer. Kills people and curses their souls... </text>
<text> Does all sorts of shit to their corpses, to keep 'em cursed, forever. </text>
<text> I ain't seen nothin' more disgustin' in all my years. </text>
<text> I ain't ever been more scared, neither. Rooted to the bloody spot... </text>
<text> While 'e did all that, to my friend... </text>
<text> Yeah...and now I seen it 'ere, again. </text>
<text> Never thought I would. What 'e does to those bodies. </text>
<text> It was... It was 'im, no question. </text>
<text> That monster. He's lurkin' round 'ere. </text>
<text> Heh...serves me right. </text>
<text> Fitting bloody end, for a jumped up little shit with big ideas... </text>
<text> Help me out, would ya, mate... </text>
<text> I don't wanna get cursed. Just let me die... </text>
<text> I don't wanna live like this...not anymore... </text>
<text> So, please... </text>
<text> ... </text>

<text> Oof! </text>
<text> What's your blinkin' problem! </text>
<text> You don't mess with Big Boggart, mate. </text>
<text> That bitch put you up to this, eh. </text>
<text> Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds! </text>
<text> Not scared, are ya. </text>
<text> Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds! </text>
<text> You feel that, eh? </text>
<text> That's the fists of Big Boggart. </text>
<text> Goddamn it. </text>
<text> Why ain't it me, why ain't it ever... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> &lt;sigh&gt; </text>
<text> Someone, please, kill him... </text>
<text> That horrendous serpent... Praetor Rykard... </text>
<text> Mm, you're Tarnished. </text>
<text> Here to put the demigods to the sword. </text>
<text> Then please. Kill the great serpent. </text>
<text> The one that devoured Praetor Rykard. </text>
<text> I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber. </text>
<text> Worthy Tarnished, brandish the spear, and run him through. </text>
<text> The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity. </text>
<text> Praetor Rykard's ambitions, though blasphemous, marked him a worthy sovereign. </text>
<text> But they were reduced to gluttonous depravity, once he gave himself to the serpent. </text>
<text> Whatever that thing is, it is no longer Praetor Rykard. </text>
<text> Someone must kill him. </text>
<text> To spare him, and his ambitions, from further dishonour. </text>
<text> Worthy Tarnished. I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber. </text>
<text> It is the only thing that can kill that horror. </text>
<text> Run it through. The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity... </text>
<text> You're Tarnished, aren't you? </text>
<text> Then, perhaps you could spare some runes? </text>
<text> Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge. </text>
<text> Well, bless you, bless you. </text>
<text> You are a true saint. </text>
<text> My name is Thops. </text>
<text> Presuming you're interested, I can teach you sorceries, as promised. </text>
<text> Only, none of them are particularly great... </text>
<text> Back to learn another? </text>
<text> Wonderful. You're most welcome, to any of my anaemic little spells. </text>
<text> Back to learn another? </text>
<text> Why, of course. </text>
<text> Well, I can't blame you, I suppose. </text>
<text> But, in the case that you do change your mind, </text>
<text> just speak up, loud and clear. </text>
<text> Oh, there you are. </text>
<text> Care to donate a few runes? </text>
<text> Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge. </text>
<text> Apologies, friend. </text>
<text> I'm afraid my meagre sorceries are no match for your generosity. </text>
<text> Oh, right. </text>
<text> I can tell you what I know about this place. That should help a bit. </text>
<text> You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water? </text>
<text> That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries. </text>
<text> Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now. </text>
<text> After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering, </text>
<text> the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here. </text>
<text> As you might have guessed, the seals are still active, </text>
<text> making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key. </text>
<text> And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key. </text>
<text> When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning. </text>
<text> Why not find yourself a glintstone key? </text>
<text> Without one, you can't pass through the academy, </text>
<text> and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital. </text>
<text> And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps... </text>
<text> Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient - </text>
<text> would you consider donating it to me? </text>
<text> I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery. </text>
<text> But still, my place is at the academy... </text>
<text> Oh, one more thing... Beware the Albinaurics... </text>
<text> ...accursed souls born of a forbidden rite of the Eternal City. </text>
<text> The curse withered the legs of the old, and silenced the tongues of the Frogs. </text>
<text> And now they hold deep grudges for anyone left untouched. </text>
<text> Thank you, kind soul. </text>
<text> For learning my paltry sorceries. </text>
<text> I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher. </text>
<text> Are you certain? </text>
<text> You're willing to give your glintstone key to me? </text>
<text> …My oh my! </text>
<text> Thank you, thank you dearly. </text>
<text> Now I can go back to the academy. </text>
<text> To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen? </text>
<text> Well, that is something. </text>
<text> Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy. </text>
<text> I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us. </text>
<text> But Sellen was expelled from the academy. </text>
<text> Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch. </text>
<text> I still don't believe the accusations. </text>
<text> The illustrious Sellen would never do such things... </text>
<text> Find yourself a glintstone key. </text>
<text> Without one, you can't pass through the academy, </text>
<text> and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital. </text>
<text> Well, what's this? </text>
<text> For me, is it? But surely, that's a passing fine brew? </text>
<text> My meagre sorceries hardly warrant such a reward. </text>
<text> Oh, bless you. </text>
<text> I'll save it for a special occasion. </text>
<text> I may never have another drink like it for as long as I live. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> So, you've found yourself a glintstone key. </text>
<text> But I certainly can't take it from you. </text>
<text> That key belongs to you. </text>
<text> By rights, you should use it for yourself. </text>
<text> It's true, I wish to return to my place of study. </text>
<text> But that's no excuse to impose upon others. </text>
<text> Ah...is this why bluntstones always finish last? </text>
<text> Head to the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> Carry on with your journey. Press forward with your fight. </text>
<text> Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake. </text>
<text> Thank you dearly. </text>
<text> With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </text>
<text> Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit? </text>
<text> Who knows, I may be a decorated sorcerer by then! </text>
<text> Ha ha! </text>
<text> Oh, did I not mention? </text>
<text> I'm a bluntstone. I don't even have a pebble's worth of power. </text>
<text> So I'm afraid I can't help you decipher the scroll. </text>
<text> I'm sorry I'm so useless. I truly am. </text>
<text> Ow! </text>
<text> What's wrong with you? </text>
<text> Stop that, now. Please. </text>
<text> There's no getting through to you, is there. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Why on earth... </text>
<text> Oh, Raya... Lucaria... </text>
<text> The home of my studies... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Be proud. You were a fine warrior. </text>
<text> Your only mistake was your choice of master. </text>
<text> Let the winds lift you, to a higher place. </text>
<text> Well, who do we have here? </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot. </text>
<text> I am Nepheli Loux. Tarnished and warrior, like you. </text>
<text> I'm here by decree of my father. </text>
<text> How utterly repellant this is. </text>
<text> This "grafting" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord. </text>
<text> He's tainted the very winds. </text>
<text> If you intend to challenge Godrick, </text>
<text> I ask you call upon me. </text>
<text> The winds run foul with his deeds. </text>
<text> I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight. </text>
<text> Apologies, but I've idled long enough. </text>
<text> As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance. </text>
<text> Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord. </text>
<text> You again... </text>
<text> I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable. </text>
<text> Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil. </text>
<text> I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you. </text>
<text> I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds. </text>
<text> You defeated him. You should have it. </text>
<text> Make good use of it. </text>
<text> I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses. </text>
<text> You again... </text>
<text> I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable. </text>
<text> Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil. </text>
<text> I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you. </text>
<text> I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds. </text>
<text> You were the one to defeat him, I would hazard? </text>
<text> Make good use of it. </text>
<text> I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses. </text>
<text> Ah, yes. </text>
<text> I wonder if you've met my foster father? </text>
<text> He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there. </text>
<text> If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself. </text>
<text> Father is leader of the Roundtable. </text>
<text> I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while. </text>
<text> It's about time I headed off. </text>
<text> I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it. </text>
<text> You again... </text>
<text> You received a summons to the Roundtable? </text>
<text> Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil. </text>
<text> The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> Oh, hello. </text>
<text> I've not seen you here before. </text>
<text> I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior. </text>
<text> Here by decree of my father. </text>
<text> The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> Is that some kind of medicine? </text>
<text> One that affects the heart, I'd wager. </text>
<text> If it's what I think, I have no need of it. </text>
<text> I am a warrior. </text>
<text> I need no external aid. </text>
<text> Not to brave the horrors of battle. Nor to bolster my resolve. </text>
<text> Oh, it's you... </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village? </text>
<text> I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy. </text>
<text> The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked. </text>
<text> A waking nightmare, made by men. </text>
<text> But this time, I'm a woman grown. </text>
<text> And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice. </text>
<text> Justice to the oppressors. </text>
<text> Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior. </text>
<text> Ah, you... </text>
<text> Please, leave me be. </text>
<text> It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think. </text>
<text> ...So you know already, do you? </text>
<text> Right. It's true. My father cast me out. </text>
<text> For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns. </text>
<text> Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life. </text>
<text> I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord. </text>
<text> And yet I... Though it was not my intent... </text>
<text> I betrayed him... </text>
<text> I...can no longer trust in father... </text>
<text> To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy... </text>
<text> Where is the justice he purports, in that? </text>
<text> He once told me that if he became Elden Lord, </text>
<text> he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again. </text>
<text> Was he simply lying to me? </text>
<text> No, no, no... </text>
<text> How could I say that? </text>
<text> Father has always given me his guidance... </text>
<text> And now...I've lost it... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Medicine, is it? </text>
<text> Fine. I'll take a dose. Perhaps it'll do me some good. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> It's very sweet...isn't it... </text>
<text> And very...very... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Is that ash? </text>
<text> I can smell the ancient storm in it... </text>
<text> My thanks. I'll gladly take it. </text>
<text> I'm...not like Roderika. </text>
<text> I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them. </text>
<text> Still, this ash.. </text>
<text> It reminds me of my first hawk. </text>
<text> Thank you. </text>
<text> In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm. </text>
<text> It reminds me of my first hawk. </text>
<text> It's been some time. </text>
<text> I must thank you, for your aid. </text>
<text> I told father I would be with him no longer. </text>
<text> I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago. </text>
<text> This land is much like the one from which I hail. </text>
<text> I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds. </text>
<text> Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior. </text>
<text> Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath. </text>
<text> Though I have now abandoned my former guidance. </text>
<text> I cannot express how much you've helped me. </text>
<text> Should you become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> I would gladly lighten your burden. </text>
<text> Farewell, fellow warrior. </text>
<text> I will remain, to summon the storm. </text>
<text> But your guidance, and your fight... </text>
<text> Surely lie elsewhere. </text>
<text> I will remain, to summon the storm. </text>
<text> But your guidance, and your fight... </text>
<text> Surely lie elsewhere. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> What do you intend? </text>
<text> Such conduct ill befits a warrior. </text>
<text> I see. You are but a simple villain. </text>
<text> Let the scars remind you; this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux! </text>
<text> You wouldn't even register as a threat to father. </text>
<text> Hurry up and die. </text>
<text> Father... I am slain. </text>
<text> Please...become Elden Lord... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Hm. </text>
<text> A new face, are you? </text>
<text> Well, while you're here. Have you, too, been seduced by the good lady alcohol? </text>
<text> Perhaps you've heard of dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals? </text>
<text> Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it. </text>
<text> And if you were to help me gather its ingredients, </text>
<text> I'd gladly share some with you. </text>
<text> The Lands Between are no kind place for we Tarnished. </text>
<text> And I'm getting too old to keep scavenging corpses on the battlefield... </text>
<text> You'll help me then? </text>
<text> Wonderful! Music to my ears. </text>
<text> Then take this with you. </text>
<text> That, is St. Trina's Crystal Ball. </text>
<text> It can be used to take slumber fog from those submerged in deepest sleep, </text>
<text> those merry fools sunk so low they will not awaken. </text>
<text> Dreambrew, I should say, is a special filtration of slumber fog. </text>
<text> Go ahead and bring me some slumber fog, my compeer. </text>
<text> About two should do it, by my reckoning... </text>
<text> About three should do it, by my reckoning... </text>
<text> About four should do it, by my reckoning... </text>
<text> About five should do it, by my reckoning... </text>
<text> About six should do it, by my reckoning... </text>
<text> And then I'll have enough dreambrew to share. </text>
<text> Drink is a wonderful teacher. Imbibe and you will understand; this world's delights, and its futility. </text>
<text> You what? You hardly know what you're missing out on. </text>
<text> Well, suit yourself. But I'm sure you'll be after a drink before long. </text>
<text> Perhaps you'll tire of this crumbling world... </text>
<text> Or maybe you'll wish to uncover someone's deepest, darkest secrets... </text>
<text> What? Taken an interest in the finer things, after all? </text>
<text> Like dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals? </text>
<text> Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it. </text>
<text> And if you were to help me gather its ingredients, </text>
<text> I'd gladly share some with you. </text>
<text> What do you say? </text>
<text> Ah, I've been eagerly awaiting your return. </text>
<text> How did you fare? Find any slumber fog? </text>
<text> Hmm, not quite enough. </text>
<text> As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need two doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. </text>
<text> As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need three doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. </text>
<text> As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need four doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. </text>
<text> As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need five doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. </text>
<text> As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need six doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. </text>
<text> I see, I see. You have what I asked. </text>
<text> All splendid fogs of superior quality. Sediment firmly settled, mm. </text>
<text> Good work, my compeer. </text>
<text> Here's the dreambrew I promised. All yours. </text>
<text> Bring me more slumber fog, my compeer. </text>
<text> Do so, and I'll have a bottle of dreambrew with your name on it. </text>
<text> Allow me a little advice, my compeer. </text>
<text> Dreambrew is known to drag people's secrets into the daylight. </text>
<text> If that's what you seek, rather than the usual fleeting pleasures, </text>
<text> Then treat them to some dreambrew. </text>
<text> Secrets are like fine wine. The longer they mature in the dark, the richer the flavour... </text>
<text> Know that, and all will be as you desire. Friendship, rule, intrigue... </text>
<text> Did you forget something? </text>
<text> Oh, hello there. </text>
<text> Have you brought me some more slumber fog? </text>
<text> You certainly have a taste for spirits. </text>
<text> I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> As you surely know, my compeer, I am but a humble man of the cloth. </text>
<text> And I must profess, the study of alcohol is but another form of worship. </text>
<text> Oh, St. Trina. My faith is in alcohol, and the hearts of men. </text>
<text> Ah, good to see you. </text>
<text> I heard the path to the Haligtree had been reopened. </text>
<text> So I forced these old bones to weather the journey. </text>
<text> Don't tell me it was you who opened the passage? </text>
<text> Nevertheless, it's rather nippy in these lands, eh. </text>
<text> But there's nothing like a good drink to warm the cockles... </text>
<text> Did you need something else? </text>
<text> Oh it's, good, good to see you. </text>
<text> I think I was about to freeze solid. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands. </text>
<text> Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery. </text>
<text> The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers. </text>
<text> Hm? That's quite a face you're pulling... </text>
<text> Need I remind you? Though I am but a humble man of the cloth, </text>
<text> each of us has our secrets, my compeer. </text>
<text> You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands. </text>
<text> Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery. </text>
<text> The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers. </text>
<text> Finally, I have found it! </text>
<text> St. Trina's, no, Lord Miquella's cadaver. </text>
<text> I have partaken of untold secrets. </text>
<text> Such that I might aid you, O Lord. </text>
<text> So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico, </text>
<text> Into your dream, the world of your heart. </text>
<text> Indeed, I beg you grant my wish, </text>
<text> That when you transcend from empyrean to god, allow me a place by your side. </text>
<text> I have partaken of untold secrets. </text>
<text> Such that I might aid you, O Lord. </text>
<text> So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico, </text>
<text> Into your dream, the world of your heart. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Oh ho, are you asking me to partake? </text>
<text> Well, I haven't got a clue what to think. </text>
<text> Is this outright impudence? Simple callousness? Or genuine kindness, I wonder? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Well, what matters it? I'll take some, regardless. </text>
<text> You couldn't possibly fathom the secrets I possess, my compeer. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Have you lost your marbles? </text>
<text> You do know I'm merely a beggar. </text>
<text> I've nothing left to give. </text>
<text> Haven't you Tarnished any respect? </text>
<text> For those who came before you. </text>
<text> Well, that knocked the wind out of me. </text>
<text> The perfect time to try that special reserve… </text>
<text> You base, facile, uncharitable bastard… </text>
<text> You're beyond help, my compeer… </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Welcome, dear guest. </text>
<text> After being out there, it must be quite surprising, </text>
<text> to see our capital, cradled by the Erdtree, showered by an eternal wellspring of grace. </text>
<text> The sights, the sounds, the luscious scents. Each precisely as they should be. Each eternal. </text>
<text> Oh? </text>
<text> I didn't notice that you were Tarnished. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Now, you mustn't take this the wrong way. </text>
<text> But you must leave the capital at once. </text>
<text> It is for your own good, I assure you. </text>
<text> All things have their proper place. </text>
<text> We, having been chosen by grace, were given this Golden Capital. </text>
<text> You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here. </text>
<text> So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch. </text>
<text> The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds. </text>
<text> Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground. </text>
<text> But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken! </text>
<text> Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace, </text>
<text> the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall! </text>
<text> The lesson here is self-evident. </text>
<text> The capital is simply not where you belong. </text>
<text> You mustn't take it the wrong way. </text>
<text> But you must leave the capital at once. </text>
<text> Well, what have we here... </text>
<text> You hunt Omen, do you? </text>
<text> Mm-hmm, yes it appears so... </text>
<text> Well, then perhaps we can talk. </text>
<text> For a barbarous Tarnished, you see the difference between right and wrong rather clearly. </text>
<text> Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being. </text>
<text> And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen. </text>
<text> The Undercapital is a repository of waste. </text>
<text> For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn. </text>
<text> And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here. </text>
<text> A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity. </text>
<text> Get on with it, then. </text>
<text> Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls. </text>
<text> I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight. </text>
<text> Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet? </text>
<text> Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw. </text>
<text> I forgive you. </text>
<text> We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble. </text>
<text> Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet? </text>
<text> That wretched screeching... I feel as if I could go mad. </text>
<text> Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you. </text>
<text> You must've expunged the Omen from the repository. </text>
<text> Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears. </text>
<text> Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say. </text>
<text> The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it. </text>
<text> No, this is above their station... </text>
<text> If I explained that this was all my idea, </text>
<text> I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace. </text>
<text> What a wondrous opportunity. </text>
<text> That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace. </text>
<text> Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights. </text>
<text> Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely. </text>
<text> This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations. </text>
<text> It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request. </text>
<text> I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but... </text>
<text> For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory. </text>
<text> Now, I need to get myself ready. </text>
<text> If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace, </text>
<text> I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best. </text>
<text> Kill our lord... </text>
<text> He is a stain upon all things golden... </text>
<text> Kill Morgott, kingly impostor! </text>

<text> Ah...ahh... </text>
<text> Ngh... W-who's there? </text>
<text> Well, it matters not. If you are wise, you will leave, immediately. </text>
<text> My flesh writhes with scarlet rot. </text>
<text> It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> If you are wise, you will leave, immediately. </text>
<text> My flesh writhes with scarlet rot. </text>
<text> You ask that I stab myself with the needle... </text>
<text> To quell the scarlet rot? </text>
<text> But...how? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Never mind. I've decided. </text>
<text> I would rather trust you, </text>
<text> than simply continue to spoil from within. </text>
<text> Would you mind...averting your eyes for a moment? </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> Well. That was easier than expected. </text>
<text> But...why do I feel so... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I...hoped to see you again. </text>
<text> My apologies, for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you. </text>
<text> Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe. </text>
<text> Even the nightmares have abated... And now, though I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please. </text>
<text> Not that I could ever truly repay you, </text>
<text> but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is. </text>
<text> I'm considering leaving. On a journey. </text>
<text> With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly... </text>
<text> My destiny... </text>
<text> It's all thanks to you. </text>
<text> My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again. </text>
<text> I'm considering leaving. On a journey. </text>
<text> With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly... </text>
<text> My destiny... </text>
<text> Oh, hello again. </text>
<text> Something about this place felt familiar to me. </text>
<text> So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here. </text>
<text> But I've only found emptiness. </text>
<text> Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to. </text>
<text> Well, never mind that. </text>
<text> I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank. </text>
<text> I must stay strong. </text>
<text> Ah. We meet again. </text>
<text> In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me. </text>
<text> The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met. </text>
<text> As such, I've been able to continue my journey. </text>
<text> Though rather vexingly, </text>
<text> I realise that if I still had my sword arm, </text>
<text> I could have aided you in battle. </text>
<text> Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took, </text>
<text> after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds. </text>
<text> I should like to meet her, this vanished woman. </text>
<text> I think she's in the north. </text>
<text> In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Are you... </text>
<text> Giving me this arm? </text>
<text> I thank you. </text>
<text> I am in your debt, yet again. </text>
<text> I think, If the arm serves well enough, </text>
<text> It might be possible for me to wield a sword again. </text>
<text> If the arm serves well enough, </text>
<text> It might be possible for me to wield a sword again. </text>
<text> Perhaps, then, I can aid you in battle. </text>
<text> Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took. </text>
<text> She's passed into to the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Ah, we meet yet again. </text>
<text> The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. </text>
<text> It feels just like my own, even handling a sword. </text>
<text> Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword. </text>
<text> Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle again, should you ever have the need. </text>
<text> Ah, we meet yet again. </text>
<text> The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. </text>
<text> It feels just like my own, even handling a sword. </text>
<text> Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword. </text>
<text> Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need. </text>
<text> I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need. </text>
<text> It is the only way that I can express my thanks. </text>
<text> To think we'd meet in such a place... </text>
<text> What could your purpose possibly... </text>
<text> No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me. </text>
<text> Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need. </text>
<text> I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins. </text>
<text> I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. </text>
<text> I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. </text>
<text> Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found. </text>
<text> The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands. </text>
<text> I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins. </text>
<text> I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. </text>
<text> I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. </text>
<text> Again we meet. </text>
<text> I can only surmise our purposes are aligned. </text>
<text> In which case, allow me to explain myself. </text>
<text> I am of Malenia's blood. </text>
<text> But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot… </text>
<text> Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us. </text>
<text> There is something I must return to Malenia. </text>
<text> The will that was once her own. </text>
<text> The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. </text>
<text> The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure. </text>
<text> There is something I must return to Malenia. </text>
<text> The will that was once her own. </text>
<text> The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. </text>
<text> Oh, hello. </text>
<text> Thank you for lending your hand. </text>
<text> Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet. </text>
<text> I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end. </text>
<text> Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> But this is where things end. </text>
<text> I pause to even tell you, but... </text>
<text> I took out the needle myself. </text>
<text> Tell whoever put you up to this. </text>
<text> That if I am to flower into something other than myself, </text>
<text> I would rather rot into nothingness as I am. </text>
<text> Please, let me pass alone. </text>
<text> The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever. </text>
<text> Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh. </text>
<text> Curse-laden. Untouchable. </text>
<text> I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm. </text>
<text> Ugh. </text>
<text> Is there something wrong? </text>
<text> Please, cease this at once. </text>
<text> Why are you doing this? </text>
<text> Now you've forced my hand. </text>
<text> I will not forget what you did for me. </text>
<text> But this day marks our farewell. </text>
<text> I did not imagine it ending like this. </text>
<text> But I will not forget what you have done. </text>
<text> Thank...you... </text>
<text> Ahh, how could you... </text>
<text> Is this your true heart? </text>
<text> Was I... was it all...for this? </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Oh, a pleasure to see you, a pleasure indeed. </text>
<text> I am Gowry. A great sage, in my day, anyway. </text>
<text> I'd hoped to ask a favour, when one of your ilk came along. </text>
<text> A strapping young Tarnished, able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia. </text>
<text> Don't fret, I'll provide fine recompense. </text>
<text> Should you accept… </text>
<text> I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there. </text>
<text> Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you? </text>
<text> I need your help to heal a certain young girl. </text>
<text> Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia, </text>
<text> resting at the church atop the cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness. </text>
<text> The rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent has no cure. </text>
<text> When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood. </text>
<text> But Millicent's suffering can be ameliorated. </text>
<text> For this, you are to find a certain needle. </text>
<text> Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia, outside Sellia's bounds. </text>
<text> The needle, made from unalloyed gold, is lost somewhere there. </text>
<text> First, you must find the unalloyed gold needle. </text>
<text> It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia. </text>
<text> Then I will tell you, as promised. </text>
<text> The secret of the town of Sellia. </text>
<text> Ah, my apologies. I rather got ahead of myself, didn't I. </text>
<text> Well, no matter. I'm accustomed to waiting. </text>
<text> But if you should decide to hear my offer, whenever that may be, </text>
<text> do come and speak with me again. </text>
<text> I'll wait as long as it takes. </text>
<text> Ah, changed your mind, have you? </text>
<text> If you are willing to undertake my request, </text>
<text> I'll gladly share with you the secret of Sellia, the town yonder. </text>
<text> Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle. </text>
<text> As promised, I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here. </text>
<text> Go on, it's yours. </text>
<text> Now, let me have a look at the needle. </text>
<text> Hmm. </text>
<text> Hmmmm. </text>
<text> Well, well, this is a marvel indeed. </text>
<text> The work of a true artisan…a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life. </text>
<text> Can you give me some time with this? </text>
<text> As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it. </text>
<text> I have awaited your return. </text>
<text> The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure. </text>
<text> Will you give it to the girl, Millicent? </text>
<text> I will reward you in kind. </text>
<text> Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder. </text>
<text> Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god. </text>
<text> A wretched fate, indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this. </text>
<text> Do you find it peculiar? </text>
<text> That I would show such concern for the girl. </text>
<text> Well, I'm the one that found her. </text>
<text> A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia. </text>
<text> She is one of my dear daughters. </text>
<text> But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory. </text>
<text> I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me. </text>
<text> Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much. </text>
<text> Ha ha ha... </text>
<text> Can you give me some time with this? </text>
<text> As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it. </text>
<text> Now, all you need do is deliver the needle to Millicent. </text>
<text> She's convalescing in the church atop the cliff just beyond Sellia. </text>
<text> Do so, and you shall receive handsome recompense, of course. </text>
<text> Thank you kindly. </text>
<text> For giving the needle to Millicent. </text>
<text> Now she, too, can begin her journey. </text>
<text> And stare her fate straight in the eye. </text>
<text> You've been a saint, through and through. </text>
<text> As thanks, I vow to impart to you my knowledge </text>
<text> of the lost sorceries of the Sellians, descendants of the Eternal. </text>
<text> Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed. </text>
<text> Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior, </text>
<text> but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young. </text>
<text> Oh, you noticed, did you? </text>
<text> Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home. </text>
<text> It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly. </text>
<text> However, she has no need of me, any more. </text>
<text> No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede. </text>
<text> As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young... </text>
<text> Is to be forgotten. </text>
<text> Ah, welcome, welcome. How may I help? </text>
<text> Do you...need me for something else? </text>
<text> So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement… </text>
<text> This is a wonderful development. </text>
<text> Thank you for your kindness. </text>
<text> Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential. </text>
<text> Like her beautiful mother. </text>
<text> The girl, Millicent. She is a bud. </text>
<text> Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence. </text>
<text> What a wondrous day that will be. </text>
<text> In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality. </text>
<text> She might very well outshine her sisters. </text>
<text> Do you have an interest in rot incantations? </text>
<text> Then you might like to learn something of the history... </text>
<text> of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot. </text>
<text> Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them. </text>
<text> She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot. </text>
<text> An Empyrean...is no mere demigod. </text>
<text> In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika, </text>
<text> the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order. </text>
<text> Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her. </text>
<text> And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth. </text>
<text> Oh, Millicent. Finding herself, is she? </text>
<text> The words of a true innocent, the dear girl. </text>
<text> Well, perhaps this is just as it should be. </text>
<text> Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what. </text>
<text> This is their fate, after all. </text>
<text> &lt;sobbing&gt; </text>
<text> Oh, mm, I didn't notice you there. </text>
<text> Welcome. How may I help you? </text>
<text> My apologies though, you hardly needed to see me like that. </text>
<text> Oh, it's just… </text>
<text> I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and… </text>
<text> My eyes began to well... </text>
<text> She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters. </text>
<text> And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower. </text>
<text> Which is why... </text>
<text> If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters, </text>
<text> I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent. </text>
<text> It must be done by your hand; no other. </text>
<text> Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact. </text>
<text> Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly. </text>
<text> When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn. </text>
<text> As a scarlet valkyrie. </text>
<text> Thus, I have a request of the utmost import. </text>
<text> I beg you, kill Millicent. </text>
<text> Before the girl can meet her sisters. </text>
<text> There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone. </text>
<text> You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart. </text>
<text> Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you. </text>
<text> Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie. </text>
<text> You can't tell me you don't wish to see it. </text>
<text> The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers? </text>
<text> I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands. </text>
<text> Welcome, welcome. How may I help you? </text>
<text> Oh how I have counted the days. Millicent shall soon meet her sisters. </text>
<text> When the time is ripe... </text>
<text> Do what you must to ensure Millicent dies. </text>
<text> &lt;sigh&gt; </text>
<text> Millicent, my daughter. </text>
<text> Why would you take out the needle? </text>
<text> You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers. </text>
<text> Would you disown us too? As your Mother did? </text>
<text> We children of the scarlet rot? </text>
<text> Millicent... </text>
<text> Malenia... </text>
<text> Do you detest us, so utterly? </text>
<text> Have you taken the lesson, now? </text>
<text> Killing me is but an exercise in futility. </text>
<text> All is well, provided you understand. </text>
<text> Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we? </text>
<text> &lt;sobbing&gt; </text>
<text> O Millicent, my daughter... </text>
<text> Who would prune your sapling flesh? </text>
<text> Such...such cruel and vulgar violence... </text>
<text> &lt;sobbing&gt; </text>
<text> Oh, Millicent... </text>
<text> My most promising little bud... </text>
<text> &lt;sobbing&gt; </text>
<text> Well, well. What have we here? </text>
<text> I-is this to toast the girl's departure? </text>
<text> How very kind of you. </text>
<text> Well, well. What have we here? </text>
<text> Is this to toast the girl's flowering? </text>
<text> You've got a good head on your shoulders. </text>
<text> How very kind of you. </text>
<text> &lt;sleeping&gt; </text>
<text> Owgh! </text>
<text> Please, enough. </text>
<text> There is nothing to be gained by persevering. </text>
<text> So, the lesson remains unlearned. </text>
<text> Perhaps you've taken one knock to the head too many. </text>
<text> We shall meet again, you and I. </text>
<text> There are countless pests to choose from. </text>
<text> We shall meet again. </text>
<text> As many times as it takes. For you to understand. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Oh, I see you've just arrived. </text>
<text> Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth. </text>
<text> I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers, </text>
<text> and explore the secrets of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them, </text>
<text> ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men. </text>
<text> By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace. </text>
<text> You do! Wonderful news. </text>
<text> Most Tarnished are blind to it these days. </text>
<text> You are something of a rare breed. </text>
<text> Well, what do you say? Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers? </text>
<text> Ah, well, that is unfortunate. </text>
<text> But no cause for despair. </text>
<text> It's likely a temporary condition, I'm told. For whatever reason, it happens from time to time. </text>
<text> Just keep your chin up, and stay the path. </text>
<text> I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you. </text>
<text> What is it? </text>
<text> Has the guidance of grace returned to your vision? </text>
<text> Ah, I see. </text>
<text> Just keep your chin up, and stay the path. </text>
<text> I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you. </text>
<text> Further study of incantations, is it? </text>
<text> I can happily spare the time, and applaud your enthusiasm. </text>
<text> Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good. </text>
<text> Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation? </text>
<text> May the Golden Order shine through you. </text>
<text> There's something I should mention to you, as well. </text>
<text> I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> Do you know of the noble Goldmask? </text>
<text> Though he was but a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between, </text>
<text> he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace. </text>
<text> And now, I hear he has come to the Lands Between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order... </text>
<text> I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research. </text>
<text> Ah, I had been waiting for your return. </text>
<text> I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all. </text>
<text> As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask. </text>
<text> We may not meet again for some time. </text>
<text> If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment. </text>
<text> Ah, I had been waiting for your return. </text>
<text> I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the Goldmask, to beg his instruction. </text>
<text> We may not meet again for some time. </text>
<text> If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment. </text>
<text> Ah, look who we have here. </text>
<text> How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold. </text>
<text> I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually. </text>
<text> And will happily pass it along to you. </text>
<text> I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask. </text>
<text> I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree. </text>
<text> The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall. </text>
<text> Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude, </text>
<text> How little it is I truly know... </text>
<text> Do...do you sport with me!? </text>
<text> From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself! </text>
<text> Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by. </text>
<text> Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays. </text>
<text> And to you too. My sincerest thanks. </text>
<text> I will soon leave to join the noble Goldmask. </text>
<text> It is entirely thanks to you. You have my sincerest gratitude. </text>
<text> Ah, we meet yet again. </text>
<text> Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself, </text>
<text> and taken my place by his side, as you can see. </text>
<text> Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before. </text>
<text> Though we must do so quietly, such that we not disturb the great master's cogitation. </text>
<text> Further study of incantations, is it? </text>
<text> Indeed, I applaud your enthusiasm. </text>
<text> Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good. </text>
<text> Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation? </text>
<text> May the Golden Order shine through you. </text>
<text> The master is always deep in contemplation. </text>
<text> While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger. </text>
<text> And though I am yet to comprehend even the daintiest morsel of his wisdom... </text>
<text> I know that this, this is my life's calling. </text>
<text> The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian. </text>
<text> Master! What ever is the matter? </text>
<text> Please, I implore you continue! Continue your reflections, your rhythms! </text>
<text> I must be the one to record them! </text>
<text> What matters this issue of Radagon, really? </text>
<text> The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes! </text>
<text> Why must these qualms come to you now? </text>
<text> We were on the very cusp! </text>
<text> Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed. </text>
<text> I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements. </text>
<text> Did you need something else? </text>
<text> Oh, was that you? </text>
<text> Yes, the master is still ceased. </text>
<text> And after coming all this way... Why now, of all times? </text>
<text> The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree. </text>
<text> While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild. </text>
<text> Until he simply ceased. </text>
<text> Now the master is facing quite the puzzle. </text>
<text> The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However... </text>
<text> The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared... </text>
<text> Who exactly was Radagon? </text>
<text> The master is stumped. </text>
<text> His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered. </text>
<text> Curse my mediocre mind. </text>
<text> The master only has me, and here I fail him... </text>
<text> What on earth did you do to the master? </text>
<text> Well, not that I'm complaining. </text>
<text> Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me. </text>
<text> I haven't the words to thank you. </text>
<text> So I'd like to pass this on to you instead. </text>
<text> A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly. </text>
<text> To think, that Radagon was Marika herself. </text>
<text> Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger. </text>
<text> How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder. </text>
<text> Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself. </text>
<text> Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Well, either way, I can continue my documentation. </text>
<text> In truth it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not, </text>
<text> I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose. </text>
<text> Who exactly was Radagon? </text>
<text> The master is stumped. </text>
<text> His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered. </text>
<text> But oh, how important could it really be? </text>
<text> The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes! </text>
<text> Why must these qualms come to you now? </text>
<text> We were on the very cusp! </text>
<text> Ah, nice to see you. </text>
<text> I can't believe you've come all this way. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> Do you need...something else? </text>
<text> Ah, nice to see you. </text>
<text> Do you need...something else? </text>
<text> I've…been gripped by a terrifying thought. </text>
<text> The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger... </text>
<text> betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order. </text>
<text> A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked. </text>
<text> Oh, but how could this be? </text>
<text> I dread to even entertain the possibility... </text>
<text> but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master. </text>
<text> Tell me, have I simply lost my head? </text>
<text> Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order, </text>
<text> why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire? </text>
<text> Oh master, put my mind at ease. </text>
<text> Dispel these fearsome thoughts. </text>
<text> I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe. </text>
<text> &lt;sobbing&gt; </text>
<text> What...is this? </text>
<text> It will make me forget, you say? </text>
<text> So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts... </text>
<text> Ha...ha ha... </text>
<text> Would that I could... Would that I could... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Oh, it's you. </text>
<text> I've finally come to understand. </text>
<text> The master was nothing more than a madman. </text>
<text> Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order, </text>
<text> seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own! </text>
<text> Could there be a more pitiable comedy? </text>
<text> Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes! </text>
<text> Ha...ha ha ha... </text>
<text> Master...where did you go? </text>
<text> I'm right here. Please, show me. </text>
<text> Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus. </text>
<text> Let me document the motions... </text>
<text> Master...master... </text>
<text> Where did you go? </text>
<text> This...is a volume of incantation. </text>
<text> It's good to see your enthusiasm. </text>
<text> Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands. </text>
<text> That...is a work of heresy. </text>
<text> Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree. </text>
<text> My interests lie solely in the Golden Order. </text>
<text> I cannot accept this. </text>
<text> That...is a work of heresy. </text>
<text> Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Very well...I'll take it off your hands. </text>
<text> I cannot afford to maintain my innocence any longer. I must dirty my hands to test my faith. </text>
<text> Even if it offers only the most meagre of hints, I will do whatever I can to help my master. </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> %null% </text>
<text> Ngh! </text>
<text> What are you trying to achieve? </text>
<text> Cease that! </text>
<text> You've done it now. </text>
<text> Faith grants me strength, that I might endure. </text>
<text> O Golden Order, shine through me. </text>
<text> I pray... </text>
<text> That the guidance of grace abandons you. </text>
<text> Please don't trouble us again. </text>
<text> O guidance...of grace... </text>
<text> Why...can't I... </text>
<text> O, master... </text>
<text> To be ever...at your side... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> A proper death means returning to the Erdtree. </text>
<text> Have patience. Until the time comes...and the roots call to you. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> The mausoleum prowls. Cradling the soulless demigod. </text>
<text> O Marika, Queen Eternal. He is your unwanted child. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> O Sapling! Sweet sapling of glorious gold. </text>
<text> Has your crystal teardrop ripened? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Unthinkable. Our hallowed resting place is violated. </text>
<text> To refuse the Erdtree's call to return, to live within Death... Sickening. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> The demi-humans wax wroth, now their mother's been taken... </text>
<text> Where are you, Lord Kenneth? </text>
<text> The knight...bedeviled by blood. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Please, help me. I'm of noble blood. </text>
<text> If those hideous mongrels eat me, I'll be forever marred... </text>
<text> Anything but that, please! Think of the disgrace! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> All I wanted was to fight. To fight, as a warrior, to the last... </text>
<text> So, why? Why, O guidance of grace, will this door not open? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Maiden, dear maiden, where are you? </text>
<text> Please, take my grapes. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ohh, there it is, the tower! </text>
<text> Finally, I can return. To our home, bathed in rays of gold! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> This village is done for. </text>
<text> Please, even if it's just you, old Albus, hide well and still your breath. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ahh, Lord Vyke, it seems that you were no lord, after all. </text>
<text> Then where is he? Our true Lord, our Lord of Frenzied Flame. </text>
<text> We beg of you, incinerate all that divides and distinguishes. </text>
<text> Ahh, may chaos take the world! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ahh, the puppets... </text>
<text> The puppets besiege us... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Raya Lucaria, hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic. </text>
<text> Why shut your doors to me? Am I barred from donning the crown of stone? </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ahh, Iji, forgive me. </text>
<text> These royal grounds were placed in our trust, </text>
<text> but we stood no chance. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> O Celestial Globe, transmit to posterity. The wisdom of the moon and stars. </text>
<text> And obscure, forever, the transgressions of the princess. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you. </text>
<text> I pray for your house's swift revival. </text>
<text> May the full moon shine upon Caria. </text>
<text> Come out, one and all, from the darkness underground. </text>
<text> And let us offer unto the maiden our eyes. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ahh, the poor fellow...gone perfectly mad. </text>
<text> Love...revenge...the frenzied flame melts it all away... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> It's there, somewhere. </text>
<text> Another path, leading back to the foot of the Erdtree. </text>
<text> An ancient tunnel. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Eek... I hear a festive melody... </text>
<text> No, no, don't skin me... </text>
<text> My hide is filthy, I swear... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ohh, Erdtree, great Erdtree. </text>
<text> The Golden Order itself, unwavering, stretched to the sky. </text>
<text> Confer your guidance. To our Elden Lord. </text>
<text> To put this weary world to rights... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Lord Rykard... </text>
<text> If this putrid field of death is what your blasphemy would bring, </text>
<text> then I can no longer abide. </text>
<text> No one can. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> House Marais is ruined... </text>
<text> Just deserts, for falling for that severed harpy. </text>
<text> No surprise that guilty cretin took the castle and our storied sword... </text>
<text> Eek...! The wretched fools... </text>
<text> They'll never find me. </text>
<text> Heh heh... I'll survive, I swear it. </text>
<text> I'll soon be back at the Volcano Manor. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Sublime, I tell you. </text>
<text> The very first flower of Aeonia bloomed on this very spot. </text>
<text> Malenia, may you blossom into a goddess. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Convene the festival of war. </text>
<text> Honor General Radahn, with a warrior's glory. </text>
<text> It's in your hands, Sir Jerren... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Let me see it, if only one last time. </text>
<text> Your splendid blade, dancing amongst the scarlet rot. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> I'm dry, dry as a bone... </text>
<text> Fool dragon, surrender your strength. </text>
<text> Let me feast on your heart. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> It's rotting. </text>
<text> Everything, rotting scarlet. </text>
<text> The very earth that Caelid rests upon, and Sellia, town of sorcery. </text>
<text> The end is nigh, for us all. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Ohh great sun! Frigid sun of Sol! </text>
<text> Surrender yourself to the eclipse! </text>
<text> Grant life to the soulless bones! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Lord Miquella, forgive me. </text>
<text> The sun has not been swallowed. Our prayers were lacking. </text>
<text> Your comrade remains soulless... </text>
<text> I will never set my eyes upon it now... </text>
<text> Your divine Haligtree... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Show me the path, O gentle lights. </text>
<text> The promised path to the Haligtree! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Only...a little further now... </text>
<text> Show me the path, O gentle lights...the path to Elphael. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Mohg, you rotten Omen. Your blood is cursed. </text>
<text> Give him back. </text>
<text> Give Lord Miquella back! </text>
<text> How dare you lay hands on such precious flesh! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Lord of Blood, your eminence. </text>
<text> I beg you, grant me a seat at the table of the dynasty. </text>
<text> Long live the Mohgwyn Dynasty. </text>
<text> Long live! The Mohgwyn Dynasty! </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Behold. The Erdtree yet stands. </text>
<text> Tall and unwavering, mindless of the scorch of the flame of ruin. </text>
<text> Hahah, Hahah... </text>
<text> Then, we are yet Golden Ones. </text>
<text> He is returned! The Lord has returned at long last. </text>
<text> Our very first lord, to brandish the Elden Ring once more... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Brave Tarnished. Take the plunge. </text>
<text> Of learning, and remembrance. </text>
<text> Recall the arts of war. And your warrior's blood. </text>
<text> One day, we'll return together. </text>
<text> To our home, bathed in rays of gold. </text>
<text> There is only one tree, and only its branches. </text>
<text> That bathe in true rays of gold. </text>
<text> Not the fool Omen King. </text>
<text> Nor the rank malformed twins. </text>
<text> O, we are the Golden Ones. The true and rightful heirs. </text>
<text> Our land's grown old, now ashen, and cold. </text>
<text> But look up, the Erdtree glows! </text>
<text> Is there still a place for us? </text>
<text> In our home, bathed in rays of gold. </text>
<text> They will always welcome us. </text>
<text> To our home, bathed in rays of gold. </text>
<text> Erdtree, O Golden Circle. </text>
<text> Grant us the droplets of life, </text>
<text> Structure us. Reveal our path. </text>
<text> We are your guardians. </text>
<text> We swat at flies, snuff out flame, </text>
<text> Repel the Omen, and undo Tarnish. </text>
<text> Blessed we, at your side, eternal. </text>
<text> Blessed we, at your side, on this journey. </text>
<text> Serve you we shall, in life, eternal. </text>
<text> &lt;battlefield warcry - rallying his own spirit by shouting the name of his home: "For Kaiden!" etc.&gt; </text>
<text> Agheel, oh, Agheel... </text>
<text> Feral flame of Agheel, burn true... </text>
<text> Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. </text>
<text> We journey on a road so far, </text>
<text> Death's fortune's what we seek. </text>
<text> Coffin in tow, we'll find a hero </text>
<text> And scraps of his great deeds! </text>
<text> Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. </text>
<text> Who rode along this road before? </text>
<text> He did, but won't anymore. </text>
<text> Whoah, whoah, whoah, woah. </text>
<text> He did, but won't anymore. </text>
<text> &lt;Incoherent rambling&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;Pathetic nonverbal wail that seems to suggest "Stop! Just go away!"&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;Pathetic nonverbal wail when he suddenly notices a stranger nearby&gt; </text>
<text> Erdtree, O Golden Circle. </text>
<text> Grant us the droplets of life, </text>
<text> Structure us. Reveal our path. </text>
<text> We are your guardians. </text>
<text> We swat at flies, snuff out flame, </text>
<text> Repel the Omen, and undo Tarnish. </text>
<text> Blessed we, at your side, eternal. </text>
<text> Blessed we, at your side, on this journey. </text>
<text> Serve you we shall, in life, eternal. </text>
<text> &lt;Incoherent rambling. Very quiet, but sounds acutely irritated and on the verge of breaking out in madness.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;The wings of a fly reverberate inside his headpiece, and it becomes too much to tolerate - he makes this sound as his psyche snaps.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;Sound of swinging a giant pickaxe. A slow swing with much weight. Several versions.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;A shout as he holds his pickaxe high, mustering strength. Several versions.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;Loud snoring as he sleeps.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;A roar as he releases the all the strength that he was holding inside. A growly warcry.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;He screams to intimidate his foe as he draws his sword.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;A shout as he holds his sword high, mustering strength: whoaahhh! Etc.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;Feeling bored and exhausted, his jaw drops open and this sound emanates from deep down his throat. It is a low bellowing that can be heard echoing around the vicinity.&gt; </text>
<text> &lt;Loud snoring as he sleeps.&gt; </text>
<text> Blessed Erdtree... </text>
<text> O hallowed Runes... </text>
<text> &lt;Invigorating shouts for repeated rapier thrusts. Sharply enunciated, suggesting proper training.&gt; </text>
<text> You're a Tarnished, I can see it. </text>
<text> And I can also see... </text>
<text> That you're not after my throat. </text>
<text> Then why not purchase a little something? </text>
<text> I am Kalé. Purveyor of fine goods. </text>
<text> What is it? Still going to purchase something? </text>
<text> Wait, weren't you...? </text>
<text> Well, you're back. Care to buy something? </text>
<text> Ah, it's you again. </text>
<text> Always a pleasure. Care to purchase anything? </text>
<text> Good-bye for now. </text>
<text> Good-bye. Nice to do business. </text>
<text> I am of a nomadic people. </text>
<text> Selling wares as I travel. </text>
<text> The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring. </text>
<text> It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely. </text>
<text> Let's say you're a very welcome customer. </text>
<text> You know, if you can spare the runes, </text>
<text> you should buy yourself a crafting kit. </text>
<text> A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own. </text>
<text> Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration. </text>
<text> The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut. </text>
<text> But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all. </text>
<text> I'm glad you took my warning to heart. </text>
<text> You've made an excellent choice. </text>
<text> There are others of my people who yet survive in these lands. </text>
<text> If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you? </text>
<text> My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold. </text>
<text> Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey. </text>
<text> But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered. </text>
<text> I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts. </text>
<text> Your people, the Tarnished, and mine. </text>
<text> I suppose I shouldn't keep this from you. </text>
<text> I'm thinking of moving elsewhere for a time. </text>
<text> My people are wanderers all, which I won't deny is one reason... </text>
<text> But I've done all I can here, in search of the Great Caravan. </text>
<text> Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but... </text>
<text> See that no harm comes to my kin. </text>
<text> We have a saying, we wanderers. </text>
<text> Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing. </text>
<text> But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy. </text>
<text> That is our code, so to speak. </text>
<text> Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving. </text>
<text> Ah, by the way... </text>
<text> Have you heard of the Great Caravan? </text>
<text> ...I see, more's the pity. </text>
<text> Well, even we had a place to call home, once. </text>
<text> The Great Caravan, they called it… but it's been lost to us for ages. </text>
<text> I've been searching for it as long as I can remember. </text>
<text> And with a name like that, </text>
<text> You'd hope they kept some fine goods there, eh. </text>
<text> The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood... </text>
<text> I suppose he must still be skulking about... </text>
<text> Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself? </text>
<text> Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source. </text>
<text> Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear. </text>
<text> I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off. </text>
<text> Oh, by the way. There's someone you should meet. </text>
<text> If you happen to hear a wolf's howl, make this signal under the source. </text>
<text> Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you? </text>
<text> Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction. </text>
<text> He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg. </text>
<text> I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another. </text>
<text> Ah, good to see you. </text>
<text> I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble. </text>
<text> Thought I'd set up shop here for a time. </text>
<text> A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything? </text>
<text> We meet again, I see. </text>
<text> It's me, Kalé. </text>
<text> Thought I'd set up shop here for a time. </text>
<text> Right then. Care to purchase anything? </text>
<text> Have you seen a crow around here by any chance? </text>
<text> You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw? </text>
<text> Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question. </text>
<text> I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course. </text>
<text> My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this. </text>
<text> And I was willing to pay whatever was needed. Your reward, as promised. </text>
<text> So, about the letter you brought me... </text>
<text> It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people. </text>
<text> And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to. </text>
<text> This could be my chance to get close to it. </text>
<text> Thanks to you. </text>
<text> Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again. </text>
<text> Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone. </text>
<text> With any luck, I'll see you there, eh. </text>
<text> I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's... </text>
<text> And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors... </text>
<text> But there's something I need to know. </text>
<text> My roots. </text>
<text> I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed. </text>
<text> Ah, good to see you. </text>
<text> I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble. </text>
<text> The shop is all set up. </text>
<text> A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything? </text>
<text> Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter... </text>
<text> I think it's pointing underneath the capital. </text>
<text> I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital. </text>
<text> But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there. </text>
<text> Well, the journey can wait, I suppose. </text>
<text> I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it. </text>
<text> Where...did you find this letter? </text>
<text> I can't imagine how it ended up there... </text>
<text> But the well might just lead under the capital. </text>
<text> To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter. </text>
<text> Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan... </text>
<text> But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation. </text>
<text> Once again, I find myself in your debt. </text>
<text> Take this, as a token of my appreciation. </text>
<text> It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special. </text>
<text> I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact. </text>
<text> Who knows what wonders there might be to trade? </text>
<text> Ah, you, is it... </text>
<text> Did you see? What they did to my ancestors? </text>
<text> The whole clan, buried alive. Sick. Maddened. Husks of themselves. </text>
<text> Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore. </text>
<text> They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them? </text>
<text> Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us! </text>
<text> The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks. </text>
<text> But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims... </text>
<text> I'll never forgive any of you. </text>
<text> I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer. </text>
<text> And...I think it's time we parted ways. </text>
<text> Guided by grace, you seek to become Elden Lord. </text>
<text> I don't want anything to do with you Tarnished lot any more. </text>
<text> I should apologise to you. </text>
<text> It's my fault that we stumbled into this mess. </text>
<text> I'm sorry. </text>
<text> I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer. </text>
<text> I think it's time we parted ways. </text>
<text> Wait, what's that? </text>
<text> That burn... </text>
<text> Your eyes... </text>
<text> You've inherited the flame of frenzy! </text>
<text> Oh, that's it... That's what I need... </text>
<text> To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. </text>
<text> The yellow flame of chaos... </text>
<text> Oh, that's it... That's what I need... </text>
<text> To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. </text>
<text> The yellow flame of chaos... </text>
<text> O Three Fingers, throw wide the door. </text>
<text> Please, bestow unto me the yellow flame of chaos. </text>
<text> A frenzied flame to melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. </text>
<text> May chaos take the world. </text>
<text> May chaos take the world. </text>
<text> The frenzied flame...burned me... </text>
<text> I was not... a suitable home. </text>
<text> Unknown warrior... </text>
<text> You, who reached the Three Fingers' abyss... </text>
<text> Tell the one... Who will become Lord... </text>
<text> Divest yourself of everything, and head to the door. </text>
<text> Divest yourself of everything... </text>
<text> And pray to the Lord... </text>
<text> To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. </text>
<text> May chaos...take the world. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> The frenzied flame...burned me... </text>
<text> I was not... a suitable home. </text>
<text> Dear Lord, Lord of Chaos... </text>
<text> Melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. </text>
<text> May chaos...take the world. </text>
<text> ... </text>
<text> Are you offering that drink to me? </text>
<text> Oh, no, what do you take me for? I am an honest merchant of good standing! </text>
<text> [pause] </text>
<text> Oh, for heaven's sake, I jest. </text>
<text> That's a very kind gesture, and I accept. </text>
<text> A pleasure as ever, old friend. </text>
<text>  </text>
<text> Urgh! </text>
<text> What's the matter with you? </text>
<text> Have you gone mad? </text>
<text> I knew you for a highwayman all along. </text>
<text> Then it's time you learnt a lesson. </text>
<text> Our people will not stand for your barbarism! </text>
<text> Is that all you were, mate? </text>
<text> Is this...how it ends? </text>
<text> I'll never find... </text>
<text> &lt;takes damage&gt; </text>
<text> So you're just like the others? </text>
<text> Another would-be oppressor to my people. </text>
<text> I see. I see how it is! You were one of them all along! </text>
<text> Trying to trample us underfoot, you grace-given bastard? </text>
<text> I'll never forgive your kind... </text>
<text> Your kind...will all be razed clean. </text>
<text> By the frenzied flame...of chaos... </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>
<text>  </text>

<text> Oh, but... </text>
<text> Don't ask me how I got my hands on them, eh. </text>
<text> Ah, back again are we? </text>

<text> I-I must apologise. </text>
<text> I'm afraid I've very little to offer. </text>
<text> Oh, nothing that suits your tastes, then? </text>
<text> Heh heh... </text>
<text> What do you need? </text>
<text> I don't want any trouble. </text>

<text> All done? </text>

<text> A customer? </text>
<text> Well, how long has it been. </text>

<text> A pity, this. </text>
<text> Our descent into savagery. </text>
<text> You've never heard? </text>

<text> Offed by a highwayman? </text>
<text> I must've lost my touch… </text>
<text> Agh! </text>
<text> Stop this at once. </text>
<text> And I will forgive you. </text>
<text> You'd come this far for your pillaging? </text>
<text> No different than a plague, your kind. </text>
<text> I've heard enough from you. Be gone. </text>
<text> All that I wanted was solitude… </text>
